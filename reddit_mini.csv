I just want to end my life so badly. My life is completely empty and I don't want to have to create meaning in it. Creating meaning is pain. How long will I hold back the urge to run my car head first into the next person coming the opposite way. When will I stop feeling jealous of tragic characters like Gomer Pile for the swift end they were able to bring to their lives?,1
"My relationship is complicated and painful, but I don't want to end it. While my girlfriend and I were broken up, I slept with her boyfriend. For three years I've been trying to make it up to her, but after a while I realized I don't think I ever will.I'm not sure she'll ever want to touch me again. She hasn't wanted to touch me since that happened, no matter how hard I try, no matter what I do or say. She does it for me, but she looks bored the whole time and gets it over with asap.I feel worthless. She's my soulmate. I can't live in this horrible world without her, but I don't think she wants to be sexual with me. I'm so lonely.I wish I could just turn off the part of my brain that feels. ",1
"I owe a lot of money , so I have to work.The catch is that barely any of that money goes to.I need a long rest from everything but my mom insists I finish and get my degree . I really think I should just focus on school and not work, or pay down my debts before finishing school. I don't have the option to do either apparentlyI know this is the easy way out , but I'm really tired. All of these issues are on top of dealing with tensions in America as well. I want to rest.",1
On the 2 of October I overdosed I just felt so alone and horrible. I was in hospital for two days now when I walk down the hallways of my school they always look at me weird and say I should take more pills. And I hate it i have no one. I have this voice in my head now and it won't go away and I can't be myself anymore. Thanks for reading,1
"Everyone tells me how wonderful I am, but not enough to be loved like I love others. I put aside everything for people, but I'm too crazy to hold a job, too... nothing... to be really loved...I'm not entitled and I don't even have the right to die on my own terms, and I'm an asshole for being angry about it... For being upset that I am there when other people treat me like shit, and can't be bothered when I'm hurt.",1
"My last words before my death,For whoever is interested, I'm sorry.

"I have been struggling for 2 months now with some health issues as a 26 year old male. My pessimistic nature just makes me think about the worst. My hands and feet are currently tingling and burning... Though I had multiple sclerosis or something as serious or even worse. Checked with doctors, did two MRIs (head, neck), they came clear.Still, hands and feet keep tingling, sometimes the pinky goes numb. My mind goes on a whirlwind thinking that those MRI missed something, that I'm part of those 5% whose MS diagnosis is not as straightforward and doesn't come up on the first MRI.This is fucking me up, eating me up. I just keep picturing myself on a wheelchair, being a burden to my family, girlfriend and so on.Suicide thoughts come to my mind as I prefer to put a sudden end to everything instead of deteriorating myself day after day, losing motor and cognitive functions.Life is already hard as it is and now my health is failing for the first time.

"I had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago (I was about 21, I'm about 26 now). I don't know how much of it was psychological trauma and how much was the concussion I sustained from being very badly beaten, but my memory of everything around that time is spotty. I forgot about/repressed it or whatever for several years. Something unrelated one day made me remember everything, it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like I was reliving it all and felt like I was having a never-ending panic attack for about 4 days. This buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol/pornography/cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant ways.I'm afraid to talk about what happened to anyone, even people I trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again or worse. I have ZERO desire to get any kind of justice or anything, I just want to move on with my life, but I feel like I just can't. I've tried self-help techniques and meditation but I still think about it every day and sometimes I'm just completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and can't escape them.I have been an unemployed shut-in living with my parents for several years. I'm afraid to go outside and can only force myself to do so if it's to buy drugs/alcohol. I'm so tired of living this way I don't know what to do. I tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and when I told him that I felt like he didn't really seem to be caring or paying attention to what I was saying he literally told me to my face he was just there to get his hours. I was devastated and gave up on the idea of therapy.I don't know what to do. I don't want to give up but it seems like it would be so easy. I am not dumb or crazy and am willing to at least listen to any advice people have to offer. Thank you for reading this.",1
"This past month has been the worst. 3 1/2 weeks ago I went on date with a guy and went to his place afterwards and he tried to force me to go farther than I wanted to go. I've been afraid to even hang out with a guy since.  The next day I was fired from my job. I spent the whole rest of that week alone filling out job app, which didn't help with my depression. The next week I started having some issues, went to get tested and found I had gotten gonorrhea from the guy that tried to force me. I went to dinner at a friends house and my car ended up getting towed, so I owe my mom $150 for that. I almost attempted suicide that day. Last week I almost tried again when someone blackmailed me and threatened to have me thrown in jail for something I didn't do. He knew where I worked and my parents names. And I started work last week but will only be getting a partial paycheck because of when I started and I'm currently -$75 for my bank account and behind on my bills so idk how much this check is gonna help. I just don't have any fight left in me anymore....",1
"Hello I am 16 years old and I want to kill myself. It would make all this go away. I don't deserve to be on this earth since I can't make friends due to my social anxiety and my anxiety in general. I want to make friends, but it is hard for me to. I have no had any messed up experiences in my life, but I have social anxiety, generalized anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder. I also am a big perfectionist. I want to be smarter than that guy next to me and if I'm not I write notes on paper of how worthless and stupid I am. I want to become someone in the IT field but I'm too stupid to get in there anyways, and jobs nowadays need social people and I am not one of them. I've never had a girlfriend before, and I want to have one because being a virgin is a bad thing and I could never live with that feeling. If I don't have any friends or a girlfriend when I'm an adult I plan on committing suicide. Can you please help me? Thanks for reading.",1
"Abusive dad. Bullying. Being a wimp because I never had a father figure in my childhood. Never getting to fuck the girls I wanted to fuck. Never having a say in anything because I'm too weak to step up.Three tours in Iraq. Killed people who tried killing me. Saw those people kill my friends. Lost both legs to a roadside IED. Wanted to become a physician but dreams are exactly that - a fantasy and not something achievable. Spent 10 years in prison after cops ransacked my home and found 5 grams of weed. I grow tired of wading through this hell every day. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, and I have a 9mm ready to get the job done - quick and clean. Fuck this place.",1

"Especially my dad. I almost do not want to have children because I do not want my dad to become a grandfather (just like how he didn't want me to have a girlfriend or friends growing up). I don't think I would even goto his funeral if he died. I hate you from the bottom of my heart. You only had me in order to chain down my mom. You hated and ignored/yelled at me since I was a little boy and now I hate you forever. This hatred is killing me, but you refuse to talk about it. I can sense your mistrust when I am alone with mom, and it is disgusting that you do not trust us. Why else would you insist on us getting separate hotel rooms when I was about to get surgery? The rooms always had 2 beds. I know you love mom more than me, but it's disgusting when you don't even trust your own son to be with mom in the same bedroom, for whatever reason.",1
"There's so,  much more evil in the world than good. Almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world, or people actively contribute to it. People harass, hate and kill each other for no reason. People get killed by natural disasters and most people don't give a shit at all. They just think ""whatever, better them than me"" and move on with their lives. Homeless people die in the streets and people think they're asleep and step over them after they were already ignored their whole lives. People out there do good but they could never keep up with the evil and suffering that goes on. Destroying things is way easier than fixing them, so the people killing and destroying will always be ahead. And as the world population grows this will only get worse and worse.People are evil or apathetic and they don't care that people around them are dying and suffering as long as it isn't them. People only care about their own money, feelings, goals etc. The minority of people who dedicate their time to helping people can never do enough no matter how great they are. I went to the 9/11 memorial about a year ago and it just shocked me how little people were affected. They just nonchalantly walked through like it was an art gallery. No emotion. We're numb to pain, we're numb to suffering, death, whatever. It's completely normal and I can't live in that anymore.Edit: this post makes me seem like a pretentious fuck anyway ",1
"Lately im asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays? back in the middle ages for example of course, you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that, but today ? Even if it is completly painless, why would you struggle to just end it all ? I myself am not suicidal i would say, even if i think about it more than often to just quit, go the ""pussy"" but easy way, why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route ?
personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown.
We dont know whats after death, because none really came back from actual death and reported about it (like actual clinical dead).
But is is really the only reason ?
Like i know im not going to kill myself (yet and it probably stays that way) because im just too much of a pussy to be a ""pussy"" if you get what i mean.
For me its just mindboggling and maybe others of you have some ideas or thoughts about this.",1
"I wish that suicide was funded by the government. I wish guns for suicide would be like condoms, given to teens so if they're going to do it, they do it right. I wish euthansia was legal.

"Title pretty much says it all. ive been thinking about suicide a lot recently and different methods. the only reason i havent done it so far is becasue im too much of a pussy. On paper i have a great life. I'm at a good college on a great scholarship in my second year, and im starting to blow it. Ive been depressed for a while but im slipping especially now that my (ex) girlfriend has been slowly drifting away from me. She finally dropped the bomb on me this morning and I shouldnt even be surprised. It was long distance and lasting really well but she just cant take my depression and constant negativity and sadness anymore. I know theres more fish in the sea and blah blah but im sick of waiting. im sick of waiting to feel better. everyone was so happy for me to go to college and its been hell ever since i came here. im surrounded by friends here and i have tons of friends back home. I have a supportive family. but i dont give a fuck anymore. I commute on the train a lot and some days i want to step just 4 feet infront of me so I can instantly die. I dont look carefully when i cross the road anymore. I have access to enough drugs to overdose on. I live near plenty of tall buildings. Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, all the pills theyve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms. I dont care about leaving everything behind because life has been pain for me about the last 6 years. I've seen like 10 different therapists and my apathetic negative attitude has never changed.  Im smart but being smart doesnt mean shit. i have no work ethic or motivation for anything in life. I just picture everyone at my funeral being sad and thats one reason to stay alive.. i dont want to hurt the people  around me. but why should I  go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced? Fuck college. I'm undecided major and im mentally checked out of al of my classes. i can just imagine some stupid fucking candle light vigil they would do for me to raise suicide prevention awareness or whatever. fuck this world. my brain has never stopped being paranoid, anxious, upset, and unhappy. everytime im happy i realize im just faking it and putting on a facade for everyone else. ive reached out to friends and family about how i feel and they truly do care but im too far gone to help. one of these days ill be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger. figuratively / literally .  i guess im just posting this because im too afraid to tell people the absolute truth except for a bunch of strangers on the internet",1
"UPDATE: Thanks for trying to help, reddit, but I don't see any reason to stay alive. Nothing has changed enough to make me want to stay. I was raped as a kid and now all I am to people is a sex object. I thought I had a lot to offer. I do slam poetry, but people here are only zeroing in on the science thing I did that was stolen. I care about people, but no one gives a damn about me. I'm just a mattress.Future grad students, know that professors can and will steal your shit. Lesbians, know that if you're not an Alex Vause look alike that you may stay single. Find someone who's worth it. Good bye, everyone.EDIT: I'm going to kill myself tonight.I'm a lesbian grad student at a conservative big name school in America. My life up until now has been shit. I'm lonely. Girls only want to use me for sex. I don't feel loved by friends. I've been struggling to find a dissertation lab. I invented something for a professor in undergrad, but now she's stealing it and giving me no credit. I want to make sure I do it the right way so that I'm gone. I'm just fucking tired of not feeling valued.",1
"I did the same thing in 2013. I did my best to accept the hospitals help and try to repair the damage I did to my body. Surviving a suicide attempt is hard, but making the decision to work past your illness and commit to life is harder. Accept the help people want to give you, and do your best to find a way through the woods while you have the support. ",1
"I've been struggling with depression, trauma, and suicidal thoughts for years. But honestly, things haven't been as painful as they are now. There is a girl who i fell in deep love with in June. Her name is Julia. and when i told her about it, she told me she didn't have feelings, but she would always tell me that we might date one day in the future so i decided to keep the feelings. After all, me and her had been best friends for about a year now, and she told me that me having feelings for her didn't make things awkward and that no matter what she'd always be my best friend and that the worst case scenario could be was her loving me as a brother. So I decided to just keep the feelings and see where life takes me with them. Then, around the beginning of september, I find out that she had been lying to me about many things over the summer. For example, she was dating this guy named Tom, and she lied to me about them dating many times (i had heard that they were, so when i asked her about it she would always deny it). Me and tom were friends, and i asked him if it was true and what was going on, and he too would deny it, he would even say that he never really liked her and they hadn't talked in months. But Tom lied about that, and so did Julia. That destroyed me. Not the fact that they dated, but the fact that she lied to me and kept things from me. The thing that really bothers me is that apparently they had sex. That really destroyed me hearing that. Apparently Julia told her close friends, her close friends told me, and I asked tom if it was true and he said yes. But the thing is is that some of my friends tell me that they're both lying about it, that they didnt have sex. I asked why they think so, and they told me that Julia lies about virtually everything, and she has lied about getting with boys before, and that there was no way she would lose her virginity to tom. That made me think, and the fact that tom was a liar too helped me believe that it was a lie. But the thing is is that I don't know for sure. And that bothers me. So much to the point where i'm just so depressed. I hate the thought of them having sex, while i'm here, sitting alone and alienated, confused, depressed, miserable, helpless and alone. And honestly at this point I just hate sex.",1
"One could say that I have it all. I'm in college in my senior year (Computer security). I'm mostly getting As and Bs. Never had a problem with any single class. I'm also working part-time as a programmer for a major company, which allows me to afford a small flat in a nearby city and pretty much anything a college student can want. To most people, I'm living the dream.But I'm alone. No one asks me how my day went. I'm just sort of here, doing the work and acing the tests, and that's all. Then I look around, and see everyone in a happy conversation...I've tried. I've made a few acquaintances. But I don't feel like I can really confide to any of them. No idea why. I just feel like they will hurt me if I tell them. They have in the past. I know that was high school. I know high school sucks. But I can't help myself.Dated 4 girls so far. Had my heart broken 4 times. One of them even stole my credit card after the breakup, along with money. Nowadays I barely talk to women. But I want to love and feel loved. I want to have a family, settle down and live a normal life. I've always wanted to. Lately I've been focusing on school and work. But every day I feel worse and worse. Last night I got blackout drunk. Didn't help. Made me feel even worse. I know that my loneliness comes mostly from my conscious decisions. Can't live with people, can't live without them.The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is that I fear the pain. ",1

I'm in 8th grade and already contemplating this shit  the reason I have been thinking about this is I have anxiety and depression that never seems to go away I can't talk to my parents about it because they have my other two brothers to worry about so the only way to help myself is to hurt them and I don't think I can do that and I'm afraid to reach out to a friend cause I feel like we could never have a normal conversation again then there's the fact that I know I'm going to grow up to be a man child who at best is a manager of a bar or gas station even though I want to do something with science but even the thought of responsibility scares me I have all Fs in my core classes because we just moved and I feel my parents are slowly giving up on me I just can't take this shit anymore,1

as though even if i did it, it would just be.. inevitable.  and nobody would give a shit. which is true. and i'm fucking sick. it's been like 3 years of suicidal thoughts but over time they've become disgustingly close to becoming reality and im fucking scared. i just want to die yknow. maybe i will.",1

"Earlier this morning it was raining, not too hard but not light. I was just trying to get to class but at an intersection I needed to stop quickly, but the car wouldn't because the road was slick. I crashed into another person's car, and I realized as I sat there after it happened that I wasn't scared. I was upset that I made a mistake and almost hurt someone else, but at the same time I wish it had been worse and that I had gotten fatally injured.When I'm driving sometimes I imagine just crashing into something, and dying. I've had some close calls recently with other drivers and I often think afterward that I wish they had ended up hitting me. I don't know why I feel like this. I've been taking Sertraline, the generic version of Zoloft, which has stopped me from feeling horrible on a normal day to day basis, but whenever something out of the ordinary happens like this car accident or I mess something up it's like I had never taken the meds.I feel like I both want to and don't want to die. These last couple of years have been horrible for me, but I still have dreams and want to do things. Before I started taking the Sertraline I was actively planning my death, but now it's like I feel half wanting to keep going and half wanting to die before my life moves forward too much. This car accident is going to cost me and my family a lot of money, and it's all my fault. Maybe they would have gotten some compensation if I had died. If I wasn't around anymore, they'd be sad, but I also wouldn't be able to disappoint them and cost them more than they can afford anymore. I'm a terrible daughter.",1

Idk why i want to die, nothing traumatic has happened to me, but i do, i hate myself so much, ill probably CO myself if this doesnt get better soon.",1
"I am 19 years old. I've had anxiety my entire life and depression since I was 12, and it's gotten worse and worse over the years. Add misophonia to that and it makes life torture. It's especially bad now because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing in life. The only reason I have to live is for my friends and family, and because I'm too scared to die (which is ironic because I wish I was dead most of the time, or at least I wish I'd never been born). But life is scary, too. Anyway. If things don't get better in the next 5-10 years, then I fucking quit. Or maybe I'll pussy out like the pathetic, piece of shit coward I am. I don't know. ",1
"It seems that the pieces of my life are already set, it seems that fate so wants, my mom will leave the house for a while for her work, seems to be my opportunity to be free, nobody cares if I die, every day I get up and I think about suicide and how to carry it out, I wish I had a gun. I think I'll find a way to do it, I've already lost everything, I can not enjoy my music like before, the girl I like is in love with someone else, I have no friends and I never had a girlfriend, that disgust of life, maybe is better leave this place. ",1
"I have been really struggeling for about 5 month now. I broke up with someone who I loved very much. I first turned to drinking and drugs to ease the pain but I got quite suicidal. It got so bad I had to make some major changes in my life or I didn't think I was going to make it. I have done absolutely everything I can to pick myself up. Therapy, psychiatrist, lexapro, quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out, started eating right, started travelling, focused on work and even started hobbies. Despite all this somet It feels like nothing is helping. I can barely get out of bed most days. I'm on the verge of tears every day. It is difficult to do anthing. It's even hard to write this post. I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up everyday feeling like I am being tortured. It's been 5 months and It is driving me nuts feeling like I can't escape. I could really use some words of wisdom right now",1
"I don't know anymore. These 4 words make my life a living hell, no matter who I say it to. In the sudden absence of happiness, I know only sadness. I have nothing to look forward to because I've fucked my chances up at even having something decent. No job, no girlfriend, and absolutely nothing to motivate me. At this point I don't even know why I'm still alive, it pains me I even am alive.",1
"I'm not going into too many details mainly because from experience people will take one factoid, make up a whole bunch of stuff in their head and judge you harshly for it, or assume things due to lack of context.But my life is a sack of shit. My family legitimately hate me
I am poor
I have some friends, but don't hear from them unless I get in touch first
I have been single for almost a decade. Generally I am ok with being single but some dates wouldn't go amiss.I literally care about nothing any more. My dreams and goals seem like stupid things that I am not good enough to achieve. I've tried, but depression grinds my world to a halt.Doctors don't help me
Nobody around me seems to understandThis has gone on for 30+ years. I am tired. cant do it any more.I just want to lay down and die quietly. All I want in life is to disappear.",1
,1
give me an injection as i am unconconscious and end my Nightmare life. I WANT TO DIE,1
I always lie.,1
I guess that's something to be proud of. I had a gun but my roommate found it. Planning on finding a lonely bridge to end it. I really want a reason to live but I just can't find one.,1
"I've been unemployed for almost 2 years and I currently live with my parents. I have $600 in overdraft fees that's going to double every 4 days. I have no idea what to do. Last time I tried to kill myself it was when I was 18. I have no friends that i can turn to. The idea of my parents finding me dead breaks my heart. But my depression + this debt is making me lose my mind. To top it all off, I have social anxiety and haven't left my house in about 2 years. I'm going to try to sell some things to see if I can make $600 (on ebay) but I don't think it will be possible in four days. I'm irresponsible and a waste. i plan on writing a suicide letter today and get rid of some personal items tomorrow. On Thursday I'm going to stab myself in the stomach or take a lot of pills. I'm not sure which to do yet. Sorry for spelling and grammar. I'm sure nobody here cares anyways. ",1
"I have so many advantages in life. All of my immediate family is alive and still involved in my life. I have several friends who I frequently talk to. I make more than enough money to live on easily.But every night I go home and drink, hoping I'll forget about how much I just want it all to end. Every single moment that I'm sober I spend thinking that people might actually see me for who I really am; a lazy waste of space who lucked into success. And when I'm drunk I worry that people will find out that I'm trying to slowly kill myself with alcohol.Fuck. I always thought if I could just be successful I'd be happy. Well I am, and I'm not.",1
"I've been suicidal for a while now. I've made 4 attempts this year.And yet, nobody seems to get it.Last Thursday, my parents picked me up from my appointment and had brought my brother along. They'd gone out to eat while they were waiting, and no mention of lunch was made. We basically didn't have anything at home to eat, so I skipped lunch.It's not unusual for me to skip meals, but this time, I went completely off the rails. I took a shower, then, thinking my parents had gone out, went to their room. Why? To get the medications that it's possible to reliably lethally overdose on. They were there, but I played it off as nothing.I can't afford to be hospitalized. If I don't succeed in killing myself, I'll end up having to withdraw from my classes and lose financial aid. I don't have any other source of income, and I need that money if I plan on living.I met up with one of my few friends the day before yesterday (after 6 months of not talking). I've been talking regularly to another. I haven't discussed this with them, except when one of them found me talking about it through a semi-anonymous account and brought it up. ""I'm okay now,"" and that was that.I don't know what to do. I  want to die. I can't feel anything for anyone. There's nothing I want to do. I'm an emotional wreck, and I've been skipping classes.At this point, bringing up suicide doesn't help anything. Everyone's just annoyed by how needy I am���even the psychiatrist has an edge in her voice while she asks me if I want to up my medications.I honestly can't say if I'm going to kill myself today. I keep breaking down, crying, and I don't know why.I hate myself for this. Everyone I know just sucks it up and deals with it. One of my friends has been cutting for a while now, due to abusive relationships with her family, but hasn't attempted suicide in years. I just don't understand how someone can tolerate it with only something so minor to cope. Two of my siblings have been dealing with depression untreated for years, I don't even know how long, and they only bring it up when I do.I don't want people to be angry at me. I hate conflict. I freeze up and can't do anything. I just have to smile and pretend nothing happened. I just have to be someone else. I just have to say, ""I'm okay, really."" the day after an unsuccessful overdose. I can't deal with it anymore. If people are going to be angry at me anyway, I'd rather succeed.",1
Hate my job. I hate waking up everyday. I feel nothing. Feel like I'm on auto-pilot. I got dumped 3 months ago (almost) from a 4 year relationship. Nothing cheers me up anymore. My parents are in another state so I just can't go see them whenever I want.I don't know if I could actually end it myself but I do dream of other ways like a car hitting me and killing me instantly. I sometimes think of just taking a bunch of pills and letting that be it but idk if I could put my family through that. I just want something good to finally fucking happen for me but it never does. And I'm so tired of getting my hopes up. I'm a 25 year old guy who is tired of it all.,1
"I have bipolar 2 disorder, and I have become hyper aware of my mood swings, they get bad enough where I can barely get out of bed, talk to my friends, or even work, and during the manic episodes I don't sleep, maybe 3-4 hours a night, my mind races, I make highly unrealistic goals. And then get hit again with the crippling depression, I've been living like this since high school, 5 years later I'm still living in the same loop. I'm well-medicated now, but the mood/personality swings have really been talking their toll on me, I'm very aware of them, and it only makes sense that my friends and roommates are also aware, no one says anything, nor do they act any differently, but I can sense their apprehension to ask me to do anything. The worst part about it, I feel like I should be able to stop the swings, I try to be in control, but it's like a dream where you're stuck in quicksand and dry ground is just in front of you, but you can move, you're paralyzed, forced to watch yourself drown",1
"Because I don't care and I have nothing left. I don't care. I had something so great, so promising and they stripped it down past the bone into splinters then pissed on the splinters. I don't want happiness. I don't want dreams. I don't care that if I post a note everyone will desperately try to stop me. I know they'll care when I'm about to die, or dead. That's about where the line is drawn. I have nothing worth struggling for. I'm not a good person. I don't care to try anymore. I tried to live every day good and dreaming and it led me here. It didn't stop me from being a massive cunt.I am numb, I am no longer scared, and the hurt is too much. I gotta go. I have nothing left. I had a lot of love to give. But its gone with me. I just wanted someone to hear me before the end. ",1
"I have been dealing with this pain for about 3 years. I have seen many therapists and have tried medication. Nothing has worked. I told my parents tonight that I wanted to commit suicide and it has caused nothing but chaos in my house. I have been looking online for ways to die and have figured that drinking and taking medication is the way to go for me. I have already been drinking but have been hesitant to take medication because I am scared to die. I do not believe in god. I do not know what comes after death. I am scared of pain and afraid that it will hurt and i will not succeed. I have tried reaching out to my ex-boyfriend who told me that he does not wish to help me. He hates me. I called him and told him how I was feeling and he said ""I don't care, I'm eating so I'm going to finish dinner""....... it made me sick that someone could have no compassion towards a human life. I've had a hard childhood, both my mom and dad were addicted to narcotics and were hardly there for me. For some reason my brother and sister have turned out ok. I am the youngest at 23 and have been struggling with depression and been keeping it a secret since middle school. I'm writing this because I don't know what to do or where to turn to.",1
"I have no hope. I'm a senior in college, and I just want to die. I don't fit in, and I feel like no one cares about me. Everyday I wake up and I try to tell myself that today is a new day, but it doesn't work. I hate everything about myself, and I feel so alone. I have no one. I don't care how I look and I don't even want to get up in the mornings. I just want to end it all. End all the suffering and the pain. I just want to feel nothing ��� for my anxiety and depression to leave me alone. I don't know where to turn, but I just can't keep doing this anymore. ",1
Every time I try and kill myself I can't go through with it but I can't keep living feeling this way. Why can't I just let myself die.,1
I feel like my time is coming soon. Like I'm running out of time. I've had enough and I'm ready to call it quits. I've attempted before but this time I can't afford to fail. I have many different pills and other ways I can end it. I just need to figure out the best time when. Maybe tonight maybe tomorrow. Who knows,1
"Long story short, I failed my degree, can't afford to retake the subjects and I am now left with a huge loan and being unable to provide for my family. I did freelance work to cover my bills and now I think I'm on the verge of losing that job. I've been trying to look for a job for the past 5 months or so and I had no luck. My debt is piling, others are climbing in their life and I'm stuck here. It's absolutely my fault I'm in this situation. I'm going to a couple of conferences and I have spoken to some employers but if they don't work out (I'm fully expecting it not to, things always go to shit on way or another) then I will spend whatever little money I have on a rope and just hang myself.My mental health is getting worse. It's clouding my judgement and barring me from making any decisions and it's even barring me from talking to anyone. I think I should have just committed suicide at 15 years old when I thought about it a lot. Now I grew up and I made my life worse. ",1
"I used to work with Hospice patients, and we would do training to try to understand what they were going through.  As they began to accept that they were going to die, they would slowly let go of things that had once been important to them.  Despite still trying for quite some time, this has been slowly happening with me for the past year.  I don't think I really realized it until today when I felt an utter disconnect to the second most important thing in the world to me.  Now I just have one last thing to let go of.  Not trying to get people to panic and attempt to ""save me.""  As if they could... Just feels good to be real somewhere.  To share what's going on.  To wonder if it will make someone else feel less alone... perhaps just me.  ",1
"I don't know where to start. I went to my doctor today for a follow-up from an appointment a week ago. These appointments have nothing to do with depression or suicide, but the nurse asks questions about it because I have a history. Twice last year I was out on disability from work while I went through outpatient therapy.But when I answered the questions and openly admitted to my current mental state being very shaky, it was never brought up again. No follow-up from the doctor at all. Makes me feel like it really doesn't matter.I lost my job in June that I had for 10 years. I was blindsided, and I was betrayed. I have a lot of anger still festering about how things were handled. I was unemployed for a month and a half before a temp agency found me a job. It was a job below my level of expertise, but I was gratefulfor it. 4 days in my dad goes to the hospital for an unknown illness, three weeks later he died of lung cancer. This leads to two things. 1) I am missing a ton of time from my new job while my dad is in the hospital and then eventually on hospice at home. 2) My dad died, and I'm his power of attorney/personal representative. So at first I'm dealing with medical decisions, and then he died and I am dealing with the estate while trying to get a normal work schedule back.(Did I mention none of my ex-co-workers from as little as 2 months ago reached out to send condolences? Fuck them, right?)It doesn't work out though, and they let me go at the end of the temp period. So I'm jobless again. Here's the thing, they started scheduling interviews for my job while I was working it and telling me that they didn't know anything about the end of my contract. Just treated me like an idiot.The whole time this is going on I am losing 80 pounds without trying. I had digestive issues that started before my first job loss and we are still figuring it out.And I'm type 2 diabetic now.It's been a shit summer, going into a shit fall, in depressed, I'm angry, I'm anxious, I'm overwhelmed, and I'm just needing it to end some way our another.That's my story.",1
"My mind is having a panic right now and I'm having so much trouble putting everything together. I don't think I want to kill myself but I do want my life to end. Everyday is so much work and stress and I never get a break. I just want to throw everything out the balcony and engage in self-destructive behaviour. I'm usually pretty good at describing how I feel with very specific neologisms but moments like these I can't describe.I'm all over the place and I'm sorry if this sounds like it's disjointed rant. I'm hoping that expressing myself will help me internalize my thoughts better and put everything in place.My unreliable memory is one of my biggest daily struggles. I often forget important details or remember things that never happened. I'm very aware of this and basically have had to hack my way around this. Everything goes in a to-do list, even my daily meals. I can even forget to eat so that in itself is a fucking project. At work, I keep a very detailed journal of what I did during the day because I won't be able to tell my boss what I did when I get held accountable for something. I can remember facts very well but never ask me if something happened, I assume whatever's in my mind is false. It causes me so much anguish that I can't trust myself. I can't rely on my memory and it frustrates me so much.Even more frustrating is my mood. My default mood is dysthymic; slightly sad but not in despair. However, my mood is like the weather, constantly changing and very unpredictable. I can go from optimistic to extreme melancholia in 2.8 seconds. My feelings rarely match the situation and I can't use them to make decisions. I never know when it's about to happen. Sometimes, it's completely random. Other times, I get triggered (not the same at the 'triggered' meme) by something in the environment, usually something stupid like a certain sound or whatever my mind decides to be unpleasant during that situation. These episodes can last from a few minutes to a few days, I never know. I basically have to design my life around the mood swings. For example, during certain phases it's too dangerous for me to drive. I find myself in despair when I'm always worried that my mood will turn for the worst at any moment. I can be having an OK time and the next thing I know I'll be grounded to the floor sobbing, for no reason of course.Hallucinating on a regular basis doesn't help either. I hear and see things almost all the time. I've somehow trained myself to differentiate between reality and my hallucinations but it's still really terrifying. Sometimes it's mundane, like music in the distance. Other times, it's strange insects and animals crawling up my wall at 3 am at night. I even get phantom feelings like being pulled out of the bed when no one is there. I have to live with all of these distractions and still get on with my life. I lament the fact that I'll never be able to watch a sunset in peace and quiet.There's so much more I could talk about; this is but a glimpse of what a nightmare my mind is. I always have to be on top of my illness and it's so draining. Yet, being an adult, I have so many responsibilities leaving me with little time for rest. Work, paying bills, side projects, maintaining the house, buying groceries, visiting friends, and so on. I want to do so much more in my life and have a fulfilling one at that. Instead, everything is a chore because my mind refuses to work normally. Hell, even 'fun' things have to go on my to-do list because I'll actually forget to enjoy myself. Everyone speaks of the daily grind but I got two of them: one inside my head and one outside. I have so much to keep up with that very often I break down and burn out. I wish my life was simple, easy to maintain and smooth, but instead it's so cluttered with my mind's nonsense I just can't do it anymore.I get help regularly. My psychiatrist who's way past retirement age still sees me every two weeks since 5 years because I'm an interesting and difficult case for him. He says I've got 'a bit of everything' but my unofficial diagnosis is bipolar schizoaffective disorder. It was a nightmare with so much trial and error with all sorts of therapies. My medication, a cocktail of about 20 pills a day, has gotten me to a point where I can 'function' day-to-day though it doesn't mean my symptoms have disappeared. Of course, I've been the hospital many times and seen tons of therapists and even 'spiritual healers' but to no avail.I often find myself desperate for happiness. I try everything whether it's a new life philosophy, a new gadget, an outing��_ Nothing really seems to do it. I end up with existential angst when it ends up feeling all meaningless. It's so hard to convince myself to keep going when even a fulfilling and productive day can still result in me rolling on the floor crying my eyes out at night because the wrong thought appeared in my head.My support circle is pretty big and everyone who cares about me knows about my illness. My fiance tries her hardest to support me but I can see the caretaker fatigue in her eyes. It's the worst for them because there's no way to talk me out of my symptoms. I can't just stop hallucinating on command. I try to explain that it's just my neurotransmitters going crazy but I know if I saw someone sobbing on the floor I'd try very hard to make them feel better even if it's not possible.I don't know how I feel right now. All I know though, is I want it to stop��_",1
"I tried to kill mused today. All I wanted was my boyfriend to help me somehow since he sees me on this depression spiral but all he says is ""it will get better"" I know it will but currently I feel trapped in my own home, I have no friends, and I constantly feel weak or unmotivated. I have no desire to have sex with my partner and tend to find the worst in him lately. I love him but some things he does amplifies my depression. I don't want to die but when I get hurt, lonely, or overwhelmed the one thought I can't shake is killing myself. I don't know what to do.  I'm afraid I'll lose control and act on impulse and actually kill myself soon. I work from home and the only time I leave my house is to take my dog out. I'm also only 18 and I feel like this is too much for me. Somebody please help me somehow. Thanks. ",1
"I have been reading about a group called Dignitas in Switzerland. They provide assisted-suicide via drugs that the ""member"" (you have to become a member) administers themselves.

"I don't know what to believe anymore. I'm a weird, antisocial, lonely 17 year old. I've never had a girlfriend (never will) and can't even talk to girls. I honestly never have had a friend before. Everyday I think about killing myself to the point where I feel it's destined to be. I have no social skills and fear any type of social interaction.
I purposely starve myself for days just to try and feel better. That makes it even worse because when I do this my dad worries his self sick over me and I am too stupid to realize that. Everyday he asks me if I'm doing ok and I tell I'm I am when Im really not. I started to begin cutting myself again and it's only been getting worse. The only time I leave my room is when I have to go to school because I am certain everybody would be better off without having to see me.
I have always been quiet since I was a kid and it's like people treat you like your not human. They always question why your so quiet and sometimes they don't even recognize that your there. People truly don't like me but they just pretend that do. This has been going on for years and I can't take anymore because all I do is hurt others when I try to do good. I don't tell people how I feel because I'm pretty sure nobody cares about me.
Even writing this brings me anxiety because I know I have to interact with people... I just wish I could cry myself to sleep and never wake up.  No one would every truly miss me...",1

The only problem is that I still look somewhat masculine so I get stared at constantly and dismissed. I cannot connect with any of my coworkers because I look and act strange to them.I know I'm supposed to wait on these hormones but I'm really scared. What if they don't work, what if I'll get beaten up, what if I'll lose my job due to just being me? I want to be happy but it's so hard.

"Ive attempted in the past, but at the last moment either i live through it, just in a hellblaze of pain, becoming a even bigger failure, or my body stops me.

I try to drown out the voices with all i have left, music.
But recently, i dont care to listen to all i have. To do what has stuck with me for all my life. Im ready to listen to the voices. Im ready to listen to my inner shouts.

Heck it is.I know life is hard for everybody and everybody is going through there own things.
 Nothing is getting better to me, and it's hard to be happy with everyone when they talk about how things were hard for them and now the light is finally starting to shine through, cause I don't feel the same. Everytime I think I take a good step forward, Its 3 steps back.
School isn't hard, but life is, and life is affecting my school work.
I wanna do great and finish college, but that seems to be a fleeting dream.
I'm running low on cash, I wont' ask my parents because they already had to cover for me, and I feel guilty enough asking them for money.
Jobs not calling me back, even though I got the job, and I'm supposedly in the system.
No girl who understands me, or who I can talk to.
I don't wanna worry my friends because I'm sure they won't understand
Feels like i'm just existing. Every bodies worried about what's going on in the world, and I'm just worried if I'll make it past my birthday next year.
I haven't thought about what I would do, I just know I'm thinking that after my deceased grandmothers birthday I'm out of here.",1
"im not good at pretending that im ok,
so i look like shit.i dont smile, i still have acne (im 19), i have black circles under my eyes and i have a very pale skin ( cuz i never leave my house, only when i go to school)
so people stare at me every day.
some of them point at me and they just laugh.
some of them give me that disguated look.
and some of them just tell me that im ugly or that i look like a fucking methhead.im so fucking depressed (for many other reasons, but i think this is the worst one)
i also have social anxiety so i dont have any friends and i never had a gf.
when i try to talk to someone i just turn red and its so embarrassing.
i have already attempted suicide last month and i still feel like terrible.does anyone have the same or similar problem?
i dont know what to do anymore, everyone is so fucking rude.",1
My last post was how I'm tired of living and the only good thing left in my life was my girlfriend but she just broke up with me and I feel so alone and hopeless. I don't really feel like going on. I really want to kill myself,1
I got raped at 10 years old by a drunk homeless man and who is trying to find where I live and i am now 19 year old boy with no friends my gf dumped me everyone hates me my mom and dad hate me  i got abused when i was kid i don't have  any reason to live anymore i want to kill myself,1
"Whats the fucking point of life if you are literally incapable of achieving happiness? Like fuck dude, im drunk and i feel even shittier than sober...i give myself one week, and if i still feel like complete fucking shit like i have been for the past few years, thats it, im done",1
"I basically just feel like i'm prisoner, I can't imagine a futur for myself, my days are the same and i'm feeling forced to do what im doing.After being bullied a lot durng school, I stopped it and stood at home for multiple years, playing online video games and making friends on it, it helped me escaping real life and the thoughts of killing myself.
Years later, 21, i havent done anything with my life, lot of shit happened making it even worse, i didnt really go outside through these years, i have no friends around my city, all are eirher from different countries or at the opposite side of it.I recently got a small job on internet that gives me 700$/month, it helps me making my mind busy so i dont think a lot, but i dont di anything beside this, listening to music (linkin park hello), i even almost dont play video games anymore when i used to do it  lot every day for years.I feel like my futur is pointless, i dont feel the courage to do anything like going outside, the main reason being that i have nobody to hang out with, i cant find any positive point in my life, i dont feel like i can enjoy anything, even when il trying to, i fail. I feel like i cant get a normal life again, feel like i'm ugly and mainly worthless.I never achieved anything good in my life and never made anyone proud, each day feel like being in jail, i just feel forced to keep on breathing, i recently was in a long distance relationship, during these 2 months my depressive thoughts were gone, i felt happy, the reason i got my actual job is bcs i wanted money to visit the girl, but it didnt happen because she ended it before, which gave me the depression back with an even bigger pain.If i dont keep myself busy i just overthink, think avout death and try to tbink about a way to kms without pain.Id like to be happy but i feel like whatever i do isnt enough, and when i manage to feel happy, something quickly happens to break it all I just feel like i dont have any strenght left to get up, go outside on a regular basis or finding anything that makes me happy, im just totaly dead inside and fake to be happy",1
"I feel like I have just a very different view on life. I don't really value it but I also don't really care if I live to be 100 either. It's funny that you're just thrown into existence with no say and forced to just integrate into how the world works just because. You have to get a job, go to school, do this, do that, but why? I didn't choose to be a part of it and I find a lot of things that I ""have to do"" to be extremely unpleasant. So much of your life is dictated by other people. Dumb rules that exist because some idiot 50 years ago did something and now everyone is inconvenienced. Extra security at airports and other places now because some fuck decided that it'd be a great idea to fly a plane into a building or some shit because of some dude in the sky that there's no proof of. Requirements that you're forced to meet in order to graduate college. Oh you'd like to be a computer engineer? Great take all these English classes, humanities, and social sciences fuck all that math and science shit. This Eskimo that was preserved in ice and studied by archaeologists will help you a great deal when you're designing a cpu or developing a program. I think about dying a lot to be quite honest. I don't know if I'd ever go through with it but I think about jumping off a building frequently. I mean yeah I'd make some people upset but is that something that matters? At that point I'm letting the feelings of others determine a major decision in my life but the only one that should have any influence on me and what I do is myself.",1
"I came here because I feel like this is the only place that I can  talk to someone about this. I started dating this cashier at a store down the road from my house and fell in love with her, everything about her just seemed perfect and she told me she felt the same but about a month in she told me that she didn't feel ready for a relationship, like she couldn't put in the effort she felt that I deserved because she was dealing with alot at work and at home. She told me that she still loved me and still wanted to spend time with me when she could but didn't want a relationship until she felt her life was more stable but a month after we broke up she started dating this other guy and cut me off. This was around june-july when this happened and I'm still upset, I still think about it every day and I just don't feel like I should be this upset. A normal person wouldn't be this hurt over  a girl they only knew for a month or 2. And the fact that I am just makes me feel like I'm not meant to be here, like im not meant to find love and have a family  because I don't know how to just let go. I used to have goals and things that I looked forward to but every day that passes I feel worse and worse and I just want it to end already.",1
"Will it help in any way for me to tell her that if she dies, I know for sure I'll kill myself too? I'm not fabricating any part of that. Some days I feel like I'm barely hanging on and losing her would make me go off the edge. I'm so sad for her and I wish I could help but she's been struggling with these issues for so long and I just want her to be happy again. ",1

"Hey guys. I recently got exposed as a catfish online and it was true, I faked my identity. I lied to so many people, even got into two relationships. What started as boredom, turned to curiosity, then obsession. I loved the new identity I made for myself; I had wanted to escape my own. I tend to have such negative, unhealthy thoughts. Suicide crosses my mind daily because of the constant guilt. Everytime I would push myself to tell the truth, my heart would feel as though it would drop into my stomach. I don't think anyone could forgive me. I know I sound like a whiner, I know I need to move on and focus on reality, but this has got me really down. I just feel so sorry for all that I had hurt because of my want to feel like I belonged somewhere in the world.",1

I put out this some time ago, but I couldn't follow any of this. I'm too messed up.I even made this, but that didn't help either. I tried everything to get better, but it's no use. No matter how I try, I always ended up failing and not getting the way I wanted it. What's the point of all of this? What's the point of trying? Moreover, what's the point of living?

I'm fat and pathetically ugly to the point where I can't even leave the house. Every night I go to bed, I just hope that I won't wake up the next morning, or any mornings to come.

"I'm an absolute fucking failure, and I haven't even left secondary school. Well, sixth form specifically. But I just want to fucking die. Everyone loves to laugh at me, for every tiny thing I've ever said, every time I stutter and stumble over my words. They laugh, because my ex came out as a lesbian, mere days after she left me, mere days after my Nana was cremated. My best friends, who've stood by me for 5 years have just gotten up, and left me behind whilst they have the time of their lives at tresham. I'm forever being compared to everyone, the same everyone that confuses me with my perverted cuntsack of a brother. The same brother who goes from trying to kill me, to supposedly loving me in seconds. My parents have just given up on the failure I am. Hell, even the school fucking counselors have given up on me. I just want it to end and there's nothing else I want more than to just tie my school tie, the same one that everyone signed on the last day of year 11, so tight that it strangles me. Wouldn't that make things so much fucking better? No one would have to bother laughing at the biggest fucking failure this shit stain of a town has ever seen, or tolerating me stuttering and stumbling. Hell, even the school itself hates me: all the teachers know that everyone hates me, yet it took one guy nearly breaking open my cast whilst he beat the shit out of me, under a security camera, for them to even contemplate doing anything about it.",1
"I guess this doesn't really apply to this subreddit, but I constantly plan, write notes, and think about my own suicide. I don't know if that's a sign that I'll ever do anything again or if it's just some bizarre coping mechanism. I just always keep plans in mind. I've distanced myself from everyone, deleted all social media, and started to get rid of my belongings but I don't even see that as a warning sign because I have so little energy to go through with it. I guess this is just a rambling complaint. It's a year from the last time I planned a serious attempt and I guess I don't know if this is another one. ",1
I cant do this life thing anymore. Im sick of everyone's shit. Nobody cares at this point. Everyone calls me a fat whore and is telling my boyfriend that he can do better.

"I don't know what options I have. I became codependent on a woman diagnosed with BPD, we had an on again off again relationship with for 7 years. I changed my whole life for the better to be with her after I met her. I cleaned my act up, got sober, found a job I love. Now that she left me in May of this year I've been a total mess. Lost my job, relapsed hard on alcohol, have no money. I've been seeing a therapist who knows my ex personally, and she has helped me understand things but once I leave the office it doesn't help. I've been on medication now for a while, I feel like the process of getting better mentally is exactly what my ex tried to get me to do for our whole relationship. I blame myself for everything that happened, and the clearer my mind is the more I dwell on the things I could have done differently if I felt better earlier.  I do have a new girlfriend but I can't stop comparing her to my ex and its making me have second thoughts constantly. I just want her back but I know that will never happen. I've been split black by her and she has a new boyfriend who I can't help but feel is way better than me. To make matters worse I'm 28 now, shes 27 and I've known her since I was 10-11 years old. We don't live in a big city and literally every street and every store I see or have to go to reminds me of her. It's impossible to get away from feeling like a huge chunk of my life is gone forever.

"i'm 20 and last night i almost attempted suicide, i ended up just self harming, but way more hardcore than usual. i have been depressed for like 5 years but it's gotten worse as i got into college and started questioning myself about what i want to do in life... i had never planned to be alive for so long. long story short, i've been in a course i hate for two years (i chose it bc i thought i'd like but i found out i was wrong lol) and now i finally decided to change but while i wait for the test to be resettled i'm in a numbness limbo like i had never been before.
to make it worse, when i finally got reciprocated romantically for the first time in my life and it felt like nothing i had ever felt before and i was literally walking on air... the guy dumped me after 3 days of being together. and nothing had gone wrong, he just.. he has his personal mental illnesses as well. but i just can't bring myself to let go of him, he still likes me, i know because he said so when he dumped me (lol). and i just.... it's been a really deep and bad shock, this overdose of serotonin for 3 days and then getting so harshly pulled down to the bottom, i got deeper than i had ever been.

"Will you ever get over the news  that one of your parents committed suicide? I've  thought about  it a number of times over the years but never gone through with it thinking it would be best when he got older but the more I read I see even those in their 20's - 30's struggle with a parent's suicide.  Now Son is almost twenty, but still think it's not the right time... maybe leave a note for him to be told it was an accident (car,etc). But I feel that would leave out a lot I would want to tell him via a note left from me to him at time of death. I would certainly not so it at home and run the chance of him being the one to find me.I was on antidepressants for a couple years. Discussed with doctor a couple months ago to get off of them due to  side effects with erection, and I noticed I would be crying more often, so it is not a side effect of anti depressants that I am thinking of suicide.

"Someone please talk to me before I do it.""I'm really sorry it had to end this way. The truth is that I've always felt out of place in this world. Places of comfort are hard for me to come by and certain human emotions remain inaccessible to me. I feel, and have always felt, so alone here.In a room full of people, even those who I love dearly, my reality seems to be from the vantage point of an outside observer, as if I'm in the midst of a movie but as an invisible spectator. I watch life happen from the outside in, never actually living it. It's hard for me to relate to others but do a good job at looking like I do. It's even harder to find people who can relate to me but do a good job at acting like they do.I have no real identity. I belong to no labels and no label can claim me. Many who have met me have told me this: ���You're different�۝. While contemporary culture places value on uniqueness and self-branding, my being unique and different has given me a lifetime of uncertainty as to who I am, where I am going, and what I want. I've experimented with these questions time and again over the years. I've failed every single time. The result of all my inquiry is nothing. I am nothing but a passing breeze in everyone's hair. I have no impact. I do nothing. I want nothing. I am nothing.Whatever I have been through, however trivial or substantial they may be to different people, is inconsequential to the stupidity of this existential crisis that I can't seem to escape. Don't feel bad about this, don't question what you could have done to save my life. Scoff at my weakness, my lack of self-discipline, and how I took myself too seriously. I'm aware of all of these traits and I know they've made me hard to be around, hard to love. I, too, have struggled to be around myself, and have spent most of my life escaping my own self.The one thing I can say with certainty is that I love my family more than anything. They know me more than anyone else could and accept the real me more than anyone else ever has or ever could. Mom, Dad, Ash, Ate, Kuya ��� you are all angels in your own right. I'm very, very lucky to have been born into this family. I've done very little in my life to express my endless gratitude for all of you. Please continue to hug the kids for Auntie Lex, and teach them to be strong in the face of life's bullshit ���  a lesson I cannot teach myself, but only embody in my own fate. I love all of you more than you can imagine.I wish I could go on living. But life was meant for the living, and I've been dying inside for a long time. Life, lived properly, lived as you all have lived it, looks so sweet. I've never felt worthy of that experience. I may not be the judge of this, but then again, who is? There is no real answer to that. So I may as well judge it for myself.I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. I don't want you to deal with this anymore.Love you forever,
Pooh""",1

I tried killing myself during a particularly bad breakup with a friend, and she told me I was just trying to manipulate her into staying. Has anyone else ever been accused of being manipulative in your suicidal thoughts? I Googled it, and literally all I could find was ""How to tell if your friend is manipulating you"".

"I've been struggling with depression since junior high. At 40, I understood a lot about how this came to happen. And I am so done with being alive. I am not sad anymore, not angry, not afraid. But I have a big, painful problem. I am a father. This makes it worse. A living hell. Literally, for me. The only reason I am alive at the moment is the fear of hurting my kids. An irrational fear, because they have a good mom and life insurance can most likely help. But I have something in the back of my head that tells me that my death would be a loss of experience and protection to them. On the other hand, I feel that I have no control over the universe and that me staying is pointless anyways. I want the best for them, but we are already living separated for 10 years now. They are used to not see me all the time. and sometimes not for a long time when I have to work odd shifts or second jobs, and I'm totally pissed and tired to be useful anyways. The most comfortable, logical thing to do for me is to just go. I have 0 problem with that. But I feel guilty as fuck that if I take that easy pill, my kids could be impacted. always having, at the last moment of planning, these thoughts that maybe, someday, one of them could be stuck in life and I am the one who can give any advice, to make their life be better. Even if they would have learned to hate me by that time. This is a really horrible and ridiculous situation and makes me feel even dumber. Condemned to be alive, like some kind of purgatory or living hell. I know that I will have to go sooner anyways, hopefully in my mid 50s. I just want to have enough assurance that my presence wont be necessary anymore. Because  is fucking hell and it hurts everywhere. Being alive...",1

"The short story is that when I was 12 I was violently raped. I spent a lot of time in both hospital and then mental health clinics pretty much all my teenage life with small stages in between going to school and being a somewhat normal kid .My family were really supportive and being the youngest of 3 siblings I had a lot of love. However I've never been able to shake the feeling that I ruined their lives too when this whole thing happened. I've been living with this guilt that I turned my family's lives upside down forever. This didn't help when I turned to suicide as my only option at the age of 14. Between 14 and 21 I overdosed 6 times all failing evidently. I'm 25 now and objectively have a a good life. I'm Melbournian ( allegedly the most liveable city 7 years in a row - sorry for humble brag haha) I have a masters degree, I'm apparently attractive even though I feel l like a hideous monster. Middle class in a developed country. But I don't care about any of this stuff. I just want to die. Everyday I feel like the same 12 year old girl screaming and crying and feeling it's never going to end and I'm so much pain. It's like I can time travel and be in the exact moment, and I just can't bare the pain. What's more is that dating is absolute hell. Ive dated a bit. serious and non serious but anything that gets slightly serious they abandon me when the find out what happened. And don't get me wrong I get it's a big thing to deal with but these are guys that are like telling my they love me and stuff. I dunno I guess I shouldn't tell anyone. It's just hard when it's a part of your identity- I never got to be an adult or even an adolescent without this. I love my family too much to ruin their lives even more..but I feel I'm condemned to life as opposed to death. I really wish the man who did this to me just killed me when he had the chance. ",1

I'm not even ""out in the real world"" yet but now that I've experienced a little bit of it I want out. I want a way out of the real world where I don't have to worry about anything. I just want to . But I can't do that so the only way out is to take myself out. The funny thing is that when I do finally get up the courage to follow through, I'm so scared of death that the best case scenario is for someone to find me and save me so I can buy myself some time where I can just  for a little while longer. I don't know what would happen after that; I haven't gotten that far. Am I just looking for attention? I want a way out but I don't want to face my fears. I'm literally the biggest coward I know.  I don't want to be in this world and I don't deserve it either. ",1
I have accomplished nothing. No friends. No partner. No job. I still live with my parents otherwise I'd be rotting on the streets. I can't keep living off them like a parasite. I feel like killing myself is the honorable thing to do rather than living like this.I'm short and balding. I'm social awkward. I don't share any interests with people and I'm always the odd person out in a crowd. FUCK THIS LIFE.,1
"When we can truly place ourselves in a virtual reality. Our bodies sustained or suspended while our minds are fed dreams filled with whatever our heart desires. I'd like to think death is like that but I can't help but feel it would be more like nothingness, a lack of existence. It's just hard to comprehend because existence is all we've ever known.I'm tired. I'm angry, I'm bitter, I'm hurt.  I want to say I'm numb but I'm not when all those things are still present. I'm numb of joy, passion and hope. I was never built to survive, I live in a fantasy world that is my mind where everything is romanticised and everything means something.Let me continue living in that world til my last breath, let me pretend. Tell me about you instead. Tell me how your day was even if it was boring. Tell me of something you like to or would like to do no matter how small, like cuddling up on the sofa and watching a movie on a rainy day. Tell me your healthy passions and fantasies.",1
"I was in intensive care for 3 weeks, unconscious but I was told later I couldn't breathe by myself and I had to have dialysis while I was in there. When I came round I was in the renal high dependency unit because my kidneys had failed, so I had to have dialysis a lot. I relapsed on that ward where my lungs began to fill up with fluid and I almost died again. Luckily I recovered but still needed dialysis. Eventually after a month I started to become stable and was allowed home, I still have to go to hospital for monitoring and from that I also have blood clots on my lungs and I'm anemic. It's been two months now since I've been home and I'm still very weak, I can't walk far without being exhausted so I don't leave my house yet. I'm pretty much constantly sick and have trouble holding food down, which makes managing the anemia difficult. I can't take my mental health medication now because of my kidneys so I'm mentally worse off now than I was before I went in. I can't sleep for more than 2-3 hours at a time even though I'm constantly exhausted, this leaves me with massive headaches. When I do sleep I have nightmares. I also itch a lot I'm not sure if it's the anemia or kidney damage so I'm going to a check up this week to find out. I have nasty scars on my neck from the dialysis which probably wont go. ",1
"I'm sick of this university, everyone is rude and I haven't made any friends... I feel so trapped that I have to stay here for two years.

I'm gonna hide $10,000 around my campus and the key to my room and if they find it, they can take what they want from it, it's like a giant easter egg hunt.",1
Im chronically ill with debilitating migraines. I work to get health insurance that keeps me healthy enough to keep working for health insurance. Im in pain almost everyday. I dont want to wake up anymore. I have a wonderful boyfriend and amazing life with him but i cant stop feeling guilty. I put him through so much.

"So many people, my boss, my family, tell me that I'm pretty much worthless and think too much of myself. I really don't. It's just a front I put on so I don't have to face that part of me deep inside that agrees with them, that I have no purpose living this life. After just being told that I'm worthless for maybe the fourth time this week (and it's only Tuesday morning for God's sake), I can't stop the tears right now. The Germans used to say, that crying is a sign of admitting guilt whereas anger is a sign of innocence. I know I'm worthless. I believe them. I agree fully. Most of me doesn't see hope anymore and honestly, ending this pathetic sad tiring life would be such a satisfying release from this endless cycle of uselessness. Only a small part of me is left that doesn't wanna give in yet, I've seen how happy some people's life can get if they manage to find courage and worth in life, and I crave to have that myself someday. But with each passing day, I cave in and give up a little more. Can somebody please tell me how I can stop myself from feeling worthless and actually believe in myself? ",1

"seriously. I have chosen not to die so many times when I wanted to and it leads nowhere. I'm already in therapy. I already take medication. I was already hospitalized 3 times in the past year. nothing makes any difference. I was kicked out of my school's counseling for using it too long, my new doctor blew me off for three weeks, and now no one is willing to see me to refill my meds, two of which are now completely gone. (but hey, fuck it, I won't need them when I'm dead right)I never really want to die. theres just literally no way for me to live thats acceptable. i cant suffer through any more school. i dont want to go to work anymore. but my mom only pays for me because im a student and im too scared of people to get a real job, plus i have no skills and would fuck up and get yelled at all the time. if i quit, aside from ending up homeless, everyone at work would hate me for suddenly leaving and letting everyone down. i already left school last semester to go to the hospital. literally nothing is worse than failing that miserably twice in a row. maybe its stupid, but dying is the only legitimate excuse to get away from all responsibilities. because theyre too fucking hard. everyone says its so great to stay alive and survive depression but all i do is get punished for it. even if some things are good or i might be happy years from now its not worth it. i honestly fucking loathe myself and am tired of being stuck with me. seriously though, if you know actual viable alternatives please tell me. ",1
"I know coming off my meds is dangerous. I've done it once before and had to be hospitalized. I recently got pretty sick and wasn't able to stomach my meds so I'm mostly off of them at the moment and I'm just miserable. I know that it's just a phase that'll pass when I'm back on, but it gets so exhausting and frustrating to remember that at my core this is who I am. I'm not able to naturally be happy, my brain doesn't work right, and I always think that in survival of the fittest I never should have made it. I think it's amazing I have, but I'm so young (22) and I just hate the cyclical pattern of being okay for a while and then it all just collapsing again and again. I'm just tired of it all. I'm not sure I'm actually suicidal right now, I'm just tired and hopeless. I know I'll be okay when I get back on my meds but at the same time I feel like I shouldn't have to take meds just to be able to feel normal like most people are. It's not fair, and I know the world isn't fair, but it's just a lot. I don't want to go through my whole life like this but I don't know that I have any other option. ",1
"No one will help.  Help doesn't exist.  At least not for me.  If no one will help, I'm sick of feeling like I have to reassure people I'm not less than two weeks from ending it all.  I'm sick of googling and being told to call the hotline.  I'm sick of being told to go to therapy.  I want to feel like someone gets it before I go.  I want the horrible truth not the patronizing lies.Edit:  honestly, what I'm saddest about is not seeing the end of Game of Thrones or hearing the next Panic! At the Disco album.

"I just can't take this anxiety i feel everyday. School is tough. Teachers are unfair to me. My grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things. Its not the words that hurt me (cause i know that they actually don't mean it) Its the fact that they WANT hurt me that does. I also have a very bad connection with my dad and its like i don't know him anymore.
Also, a girl i really like was the only life goal i had in life. She was the only thing that kept me going and was the only reason i got up in the morning. I asked her out and said that i really liked her and she said that she felt the same way too. About 6 hours later she texted me and said she changed her mind and it absolutely crushed me. Even though its been a while now i still can't seem to move on
I also started smoking weed because its the only thing that can give me life but it seems like im growing an addiction to it sense i feel more more depressed without it.  I don't think i will really end my life sense i know how much that would've hurt mom and she have gone through enough shit already. But Its just so much work for me to fix all of this.I hope someone cares to read this. I feel desperate Edit: before anyone tells me what i felt was just teenage love ill just say that she was more symbolic then a love interest. I loved her so i could have a reason to live.

"I've never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake ( that's mostly better now though... I sleep almost every night)But I am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression? I've spoken to people I know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesn't seem to fit how they describe it...Sometimes I get waves of despair and hopelessness, when this happens I literally can't even imagine a future, not even tomorrow... It scares me as my imagination is just taken away and I am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better. I mean this literally too, as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all...Other times I go numb, there's no emotion, no anything... The first time this happened was when my one of my parents was in hospital after a heart attack when I was 10. I logically without emotion made the decision to kill myself if they died. My other parent was crying, praying, pleading to people meanwhile I just became this emotionless logical creature doing maths puzzles working out how many ceiling tiles made up the ceiling of the hospital etc... My emotions only came back about 24 hours later the next evening when visiting the parent who had been taken into the hospital.I am constantly anxious and scared... A few people have noticed I can be very disconnected and remove myself to situations. I put on a good front but now I'm in my 30s I feel more fragile? In the past few years I've had bouts where I can't get suicide off of my mind, but the guilt of how it would effect my niece is the only thing that's kept me from doing it. I often have dreams of killing myself and seeing how everyone would quickly adapt, accept and be better off without me and these feel like happy dreams.When someone I knew killed themselves earlier this year people adapted and dealt with it so quickly... And I don't let people in as close as he did so they'd be fine if it were me.",1

"If consciousness survives after death, it's reasonable to assume it doesn't age or die and is endless. If it doesn't, then life is restricted to the few years we spend on this planet. Either way, there is no point in continuing a human existence. Mine sucks, so why shouldn't I end it?",1
"This is my first reddit post ever. Well, I don't really know where to start. Ever since I was 13, I've wanted to kill myself. I remember the first time I seriously contemplated taking my own life. I'm second oldest of 6 kids, so it gets pretty overwhelming and chaotic at my house sometimes.  At the time, my entire family (6 people at the time, with my pregnant mom), my aunt and uncle, our babysitter/close family friend, and one of my family's friend who was my age were in a beach house together. By some miracle, I had my own room and I was laying on my bed. I was thinking about my life. The entire summer, my dad and my older brother had been picking on me. They would fuck around with me, taking my stuff and throwing it back and worth, jokingly calling me insults. They were like school bullies, but I was homeschooled so it was a constant thing. It wasn't that bad looking back on it, and I don't know why it was making me hurt so bad. So many other people go through so much more and they remain stronger than I ever am. But this continued throughout the years, getting worse by the day. My family moves around about every 4-5 months, so I can't enroll in normal school. I don't have trouble making friends, but after constantly moving and knowing I would never see my friends again made me not even try to anymore. So, I became isolated, and I was constantly bored of my life. I had no social life at all at some times and it didn't really help that I have super conservative parents, who might actually be crazy. I'm not allowed to hang out with guys (my mom told me before going off to a summer program that she would rather see me do drugs than have a boyfriend), I'm not allowed out without a thorough explanation of where I am going and what I am doing and even then they might say no, and a bunch of other crazy rules. So, naturally I spent all my free time on the internet. One summer, I saw my brother had a tinder account, and I decided to make one. I was 13 at the time, and that's a ridiculous age to be on tinder. So I start to go on it, and I'm chatting with all these random dudes. They're telling me exactly what I needed to hear. Compliments. Of course, their end goals are nudes and sex, but I was eating it up. And then I started sending nudes. I was so insecure about myself that I resorted to finding horny guys on the internet to make me feel good enough about myself. I used the app on and off for a couple years (I never met up with anybody from it), whenever I needed a quick boost of confidence. The story goes on, and throughout those few years I was a really good kid. At 14 I got into an Ivy League university and since then I've been taking classes (class of 2019!). But then I began acting out. I started to not really care about my classes (I wasn't failing at all, but not doing as good as before), and I yearned to go out and party my ass off. So when living in a strict boarding school, I completely isolated myself from everyone. I didn't have a roommate and during the day I would do whatever I had to (tennis practice and go to the school room) and then I'd go right back to my room and do whatever. My younger sister also went to that school, and we have a history. I won't go extremely in depth, but my whole life she has literally been out to get me. And while we were at the school together, she made it her #1 priority to make everyone think I was weird. She made up stories about me to them, spread rumors and a bunch of other petty stuff. But after Christmas break, I was fixated on getting lit, so I became a social person again. I told everyone I just had a super difficult last semester, but now I have an easier one so more time on my hands. I hung out with people, made friends, started to be known by people. And the first week, my new roommate brought me with her when she snuck up into the room of the two ""cool and popular"" girls of the school. We snuck out of our rooms and sprinted up, and when we got there they weren't expecting me to be there and got kinda weirded out. It was really awkward at first, but then they asked me  what was a really bad but kinda funny thing I did and I straight up said ""I 69 with a guy once, but I don't think that's really for me"" and as most high school girls would, they got a kick outta that. So we started talking more, and they realized I was actually kinda cool and funny and then they told me how my sister (we'll call her G) told them that I was so weird and this and that. But they liked me, so I was like ok cool. This ""friendship"" (it was obviously bs and fake, because these girls are the fakest people I've ever met) started to grow and then one day the most popular girl got her adderall in the mail (her mom would mail it to her every month), and she was like ""wanna try it?"". So I did, because I'd been wanting to try it . This was the first time I did drugs or anything (even drinking), but I had wanted to. I had a great first experience with it, I ended up staying up all night (dumb me took it at 9:30 at night) and I got all my homework done for the week and organized my entire room. It was great. So after that, I bought 7 pills from her to use on special occasions (midterms, finals, only when I needed it). This April (all of this is pretty recent), I got suspended from that boarding school for 2 weeks (it's pretty hard to get suspended from a boarding school, because they have to send you home and some kids lived out of the country), because I got drunk in a guy's room (we weren't allowed into the guys' rooms as girls and vice-versa). This was my most fucked up night ever. The popular girl (We will call her ""B"") forced herself onto me and kissed me, then pushed me down and I hit my head on the side of the bed (only was bleeding a tiny bit) and both of us made out with the 3 other guys there. She ends up going into the bathroom with two other guys (doing who knows what) so my drunken self was determined to keep her from getting raped or anything like that (she was sooo wasted and out of it), but I am a pretty small girl, so it was hard for me to do something when a guy who is 6'1"" is telling me he's gonna beat the shit out of me if I don't shut tf up. But I persisted, and got her out of there and kept on fighting off guys that would try to take advantage of her. Long story short, we both got back to our rooms after she threw up all over their bathroom. And then we got caught and the next day were asked all about what had happened. Well, I learned nothing from this, just that I didn't regret doing that at all and wanted to do something like that again (minus all those fucked up things). So I served my suspension, and my strict parents were so fucking mad during it. I have no idea what they were thinking, but they sent me back there. This time, with another sister in tow. I began to get into vaping and I ordered a bunch of shit online and got it delivered there. And then this kid came along and started talking about wanting a vape and I offered to get him one. I overcharged tf outta him and made some money (my parents don't give me any, so I gotta make my own) and so we started with vaping. Then we got nicotine juice, and then we moved to weed. I fell in love with weed. But with my crazy sister always around, she eventually found out through overhearing conversation and interrogating people about me, and began to spread some crazy rumors. So then, she told the head at our school and I was so close to being drug tested (I was throwing up because I was sick the day they were going to take me). I would've failed and prob be expelled. G continued to blackmail me, threatening to tell everyone. I also found out she was showing people a vid she took of me once (I have absolutely no idea how she took it) masturbating. So, she was spying on me too and recording it.I was devastated after this, and asked her why she was doing all of this to me. She thought it was all a funny joke. And I said we would be better off as friends than enemies and she said ""I don't give a fuck about you"". That hurt me the most through all of this. I cut myself for a brief period of time, and then realized it wasn't for me. So now, I smoke weed everyday, just to escape from these memories that I can't let go of. My friend commuted suicide last weekend, and it impacted me quite a bit, in that I realized the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my two closest friends. They don't even know it, but they're the reason I stick around. I want to get away from my family, but I don't know how to. I want to tell my parents that I'm suicidal all the time and that I need help, but I can't. My brother attempted to kill himself about 2 years ago my slitting his wrist (then he called the cops on himself) and when they were talking about this, they told me and my two younger siblings that he was doing it to hurt them because they were putting pressure on him to get his GED. They laughed at what he did, and kept him in the mental hospital for a couple extra days so he could ""learn his lesson"". They took his fucking shoelaces away and they laughed at him. I was speechless that they would say this, especially to their 11,12 and 14 year old kids. I'm 16 now, and I want to move out, the only way I can be happy is when I'm away with them, but they won't let me. Any tips on how to get through the next two years living with them? Sorry for the essay lol, I just don't know why I hate my life so much, because again so many people have been through so much more. I'm so grateful that I have these opportunities and I wish I could give it all to someone who has nothing, because I'm not worthy of what I have. Thanks for listening,-S",1
"So I was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were Jehovah witnesses.I have never gone to somebody house before because the think anything that requires you to interact with people who aren't in their ���religion�۝ is Satan trying to persuade you.

"Hey all, it's my first time posting here and I'm not really sure what to write, so I'll just ramble on. I've had pretty bad depression for about 4 years now, and just over 2 years ago I finally came out to my family about my depression and suicidal thoughts and got some help.I guess I'm a person who needs to be in a relationship. Not long after seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist (who started me on 2 meds) I started seeing someone who I met online, and we got married a year later. I was really happy in that relationship, but we were from 2 different countries. We were together, but there was a million hurdles towards getting residency that took a toll on our relationship. Eventually we decided to get separated, and I moved back home. That was about 3 months ago, and it's been hell ever since.I've always had trouble sleeping, but now all I can think about is my wife. Literally every night I think about how if things don't work out, I don't want to continue living. It's gotten so bad that I will stay up until I pass out, so I don't have to deal with my inner thoughts. One of the most depressing things for me is that I have every opportunity in the world to do anything I want. I'm not rich by any means, but my family isn't poor. My parents are super supportive, and my home life is great. The fact that I feel this way makes me even more depressed, because tons of people have it worse than I do, but they make it work. I have never attempted suicide before, but I've come close a few times. My main reason for not doing it, is that it would destroy my family. While that keeps me going, it doesn't solve anything. I have no goals, no dreams, and all I wanted to do was be with my wife overseas. I'm in no position to seek another relationship, but I also feel like I'm only happy when I'm with someone. Anywho, I guess I just wanted to see this all written out. My willpower to resist the urge to end it all gets weaker as time goes on. Thanks for reading.",1
"Basically, I have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now. I went from being legitimately suicidal, to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts. I am not currently in danger, but I wanted some help. I frequently think of what would happen if I killed myself. I think of the personal experience,  the pain, the person that finds me, the people that may or not care about me, how it would affect family and friends, does it make me go to Hell, etc.Is this something to be concerned about? Again, this may be deleted to cover up my emotions, but I wanted to get some help first.Thank you all.",1
A few months ago I wrote a list of things I wanted to watch/play/listen/read before killing myself. I've now done pretty much everything in that list except one thing; watch Blade Runner 2049.

"Hi. I'm a 14 year old boy that lives in the US. I really don't know if I'm depressed or not but I just want to kill myself from day to day. Honestly at first it was fine.

My sister even had a breakdown saying she wanted to kill herself for the longest time. But now back to me. I'm literally crying right now.

In fact I think I cried more in a span of 2 months than the span of 2 years before that. I'm constantly sad and thinking of dying quietly and just catch a breath. But there is one thing that saves me. It's school and I can keep a smile on in front of everyone. I mean I got friends and I got girls that I would like to impress not drive away. I'm just sad, Idk if this is depression or what but whatever. Sorry. I just wanted to spread my feelings as I have no one to truly give myself out to. I mean it's the internet. What could go wrong ? :) If you read til the end, thank you but I just wanted to throw my thoughts and feelings out somewhere. I'll do fine I think.",1
"just what the title says. so here goesNot sure what to do anymore. Always been shy. didn't learn how to be responsible, accountable. No study habits. No sense of finance and bills. Parents still paying my bills. I know where to go to seek help, what to do, just not how to ask for help. Failing classes, neglecting academics and career. can't get myself to study even though I have an exam tomorrow which I know i'm probably gonna fail. haven't turned in any assignments yet and they're all more than a week past due date now. don't know how to talk to people, how to communicate. haven't spoken to anyone in class yet, not even the professors. Never had a proper relationship with anyone, no friends let alone a girlfriend or any romantic relationships, never held hands with anyone or kissed anyone, sex is just something other people have that I can't, just like all other human experiences. haven't eaten a proper meal in a month now. Just surviving on water, coffee, bread, milk and alcohol. Smoking a pack a day. Barely sleeping or sleeping too much. No physical exercise or socializing. Just wasting my parents resources and retirement funds. haven't spoken to my sister in over four years now. But she already has a good job and is graduating in spring so i'm happy for her. She means the world to me even though we're not even on speaking terms. Pushing away friends and family. Difficulty in communicating is taking a toll. i'm so behind in all my classes but I can't ask for help from professors because what will they think of a grad student who doesn't spend enough time studying. haven't spoken to anyone in class yet so no study groups either. i'm running out of pain killers that I brought along from back home and I don't know how i'd muster enough confidence to go out and get more by myself. i'm 24, six feet tall but weigh around fifty five kilos. My arms look like spider legs. My acne won't go away and makes my face look like a jackson pollock painting. My hips are hurting most of the time as is my shoulder and my back. I just want to end it all and if that means ending my life then so be it. I know I am going to kill myself. Maybe not now, not today, not this week or even not in the next few years or ten years. But that is how I will end I am sure of it. I smoke in the hopes of getting cancer or a heart attack from clogged arteries. I have no motivation to do anything anymore, no hope for the future, everything seems pointless.Wow, I am one fucked up non functioning non human.

"I have a feeling that this year is going to be my last year.I never had such feelings before. I've been depressed for more than three quarters of a decade, and during this time it kept getting worse and worse. Recently I decided that I have had enough and I want to rest. I'm nothing but a failure and i drag everyone around me down. I've never been good at anything, always disappointed everyone around me and I don't have real life friends. Haven't had any in many years. I had a person I loves but she's gone and never coming back (didn't work out i guess. She never loved me to begin with, but whatever)You get to a point where you just wonder if its all in your head or if its real. I genuinely don't know if i am crazy or not. Fuck it. I feel at peace and happy with my decision. I shan't be missed or whatever. C'est la vie. I'll be back on the day I do it to say good bye. Not like it matters. I'm a bitter asshole. ",1
"Hi Everyone, I'm 25/F and in grad school for a masters degree that I don't really want anymore. My parents convinced me it would help me get a good job, but I have no idea how much longer it's going to take, and my anxiety is only getting worse. I have tried consulting a psychologist and therapist, but I am still covered through my parents insurance, and they do not want me on any anti depressants or anti anxiety medication. So here I am. I know my parents mean well, and I am lucky they are able to still help support me, but I can't take this anymore. I wish I could just leave or drop out, but my loans coming out of deferment would likely cause them a lot of financial issues. I have a boyfriend of 4.5 years that is incredibly supportive and tries to help when he can. I have a history of self harm (hitting myself) that has relapsed since I began grad school, and only he knows about it. I am too afraid of pain and hurting those around me to actually commit suicide, but I have had an overwhelming feeling on and off over the years that I wish I could get in a bad accident, or have something bad happen to me. I wish more than anything that I could drop out and just move on with life.",1
"I've always had this positive attitude about anything, but now I'm just tired. Tired of life and everything.School is hard. I can't even imagine going through the next three years only to then lose all my friends.Ah. Friends - well I don't have many real friends, a handful to be exact, but that's not the problem, I'm happy with those I have + I get along with many people.Love is my problem. I know, I know. I'll get over her. I've heard that so many times, I'm getting sick of it. You know, I'm in love with one of my real, good friends. But she doesn't like me as much as she likes others. I feel like a second class friend when we're around with other friends of ours. I have oneitis.I'm also very, very ugly and kinda fat. But I'm currently trying to fix the latter so that might not be a problem in a year. Ugliness won't go away. That's also why I won't have a chance with her.And today, I've been at this girl's house with others and I was the last to leave. I couldn't say a word to her. I just said ""Bye"" and left. I hate myself now, can't even talk to a girl.I was alone waiting for the bus in the pouring rain, and there it happened: Why not kill myself here and now? Solves my problems once and for all.Sorry if this isn't the place for this, I'm just scared of what will come next. Will this repeat itself when I'm alone again? Will I eventually attempt suicide? It's the first time I've had this problem and it really scares me.I'm not at risk, just tired and scared. I want my problems solved but I can't do it myself.",1
"I'm a 16 year old from California. I read somewhere that if you call the cops on yourself for being suicidal, they'll take you to a hospital.

My husband caught me. I'm sad.,1
"To the hospital as recommended?  I always ask for a Permanent rest.  And no-one can provide or afford that for me.  It's not really of value for people to just rest all the time.
My soul is really broken and I'm in more pain than is worthwhile. So what's your plan for me? After all the therapy and all the drugs at all the hospitalization? It's clear you have no plan other than to just send me back and hope I keep working. Put the onus on me to keep functioning and that's a plan failure",1
"I've decided that I can no longer deal with the hardship or struggle of life and have decided to end it today, I am not sure as I am posting here perhaps it is because I have no one that cares about me so I just want to get it off my chest.
My life is so diffifult and recently got 20 x worse
I came across this subreddit when I searched for suicide help/Hotlines etc I contacted 3 of them and WOW what I waste that is all saying the WRONG things and very generic , DO NOT say to a suicidal person anything about family from what would they think  or think about them ... Anything chances are the person A has no family or B ( me) had a horrible childhood where they were abused etc. point is the hotlines made me feel worse.
I could ramble on forever but no one likes a sob story
I went from a good job and decent life to losing nearly everything in not a long time span it's been a decline and got more and more depressed with each day, my main reason now is  am less than broke I have been through some real shit and do not want - no can not deal - going from a real apt to a shitier one and another and another to a shitty temp spot sometimes I don't eat
I bust my ass to help myself no am not improving  I have been paying for a weekly room which I am overdue on and I will be on the street tomorrow - in fkn NYC - the worst of the worst, If I don't do it myself someone will stab me on the subway at least.
Not to mention Dr's don't want to hear me out or help they don't care ( at least not in this city ) I have no religion o PLEASE do not come at me with that but that is it a not so young 30-something year old guy I see no other way out.",1
"So I'm 25 years old and have several health issues for many years now, mostly chronic pain (RLS, ""burning"" eyes and some other stuff), none of which could be cured or even be reduced to an acceptable level yet.
In addition to that there are some other problems like mouches volantes, which really drive me crazy.
I know that the mentioned things are considered ""harmless"", but that's only true for the physical part.
I'm rarely sleeping more than 5 hours, and when I wake up the first thing I feel is pain. Legs, eyes, everywhere.
I'm also having a slight form of socialphobia. It's not that I can't talk to people or instantly panic when there are more than 3 people around me, I can manage it pretty well, but it still doesn't feel good.All of those things don't exactly make it easy for me to wake up, jump out of my bed and scream ""What a beautiful day!"".
So afterall I dropped university this spring cause I couldn't handle it anymore. I got some tiny jobs here and there, but afterall it wasn't enough - and of course I wasn't going anywhere with it.So now I got kicked out of my flat (because I couldn't pay the bills), have no money, no place to go and still a few hundred bucks I need to pay. Well I know a few hundred bucks may not sound much, but for me it is a hell of a lot.So right now I literally have nothing. No health, no future, no money.This may sound like a spontaneous reaction - but it's not.
I had suicidal thoughts years ago before I left university, but it was not the typical ""My girlfriend left me, I'm so sad!"" or whatever stuff, I had serious problems for years and had enough time to think about all of that.
I'm not talking about ""soon I'm going to kill myself ... if I want to ... maybe"", but about placing a rope next to me and trying to have the guts to do it.Probably the only reason I haven't done it yet are my parents, especially my lovely mom.
But with every day passing I tend more and more to do it anyways, because I see no other option.I know that there are people that have very serious problems and/or a terrible life, and they have my biggest respect if they keep on going, but I can't.
When life becomes a painful struggle every single day, without the hope for anything to change, it is not worth living in my opinion.",1
hey man,1
"This may not be the place. But I'm just coming off of a 5 day binge and nights with suicidal thoughts. For you, what are some recovery methods you've done to bounce back? If you even decide to do that. Again I don't know if this is the right place.",1

Ending things now is a solution.
Don't want to live 50 more years to be sure all of this is pointless.
Don't want to be a bad friend anymore.
Don't want to be a bad son anymore.
Don't want to be a bad parent.
Don't want to be a worthless human being.  ",1
Im so scared,1
None of this matters I'm useless.,1
"Which isn't saying much, since I think about suicide a lot. But lately, I've really wanted to go through with it. I'm just tired, I'm tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and I can't stand it any longer. I don't trust any government institutions like therapists, I've taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than I already was or just not work at all. I can't even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or I could go to prison if I did. My health is shit, it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors I keep going to tell me everything is fine, I just need to lose weight - even though I already have a eating disorder (and lost 100 pounds, and I'm not even that fat) and can't exercise very much due to my shitty health. Speaking of shitty health, I can't work anywhere because of it and so I'm destined to be on disability my entire life. I can't even afford my basic needs, I have to steal from the grocery store just to be able to eat a nutritious diet that doesn't consist of mostly sugar, calories and salt. I am going to end up homeless because rent everywhere is getting way too expensive for me to even afford and every place that offers housing assistance is packed full (I hate apartment living anyways), and I'd actually prefer homelessness, if it meant that I didn't have to live with a shitty roommate (which I've only had 2 roommates ever who weren't shitty abusive people). I can't do relationships or get close to anyone, I'm too PTSD'd about trauma from shit that has been done to me by other people all of my life and I can't get close to anyone because I have to keep important details of my life hidden away from people, so I basically have to be dishonest with people in order for anyone to even want to be in my life. Meditation, I don't get...some new age BS that doesn't accomplish anything for me. I've tried CBT exercises, that doesn't work either because a lot of it is wishy washy BS (or is at least presented that way) and doesn't reflect reality, especially my reality.I could go on and on about how my entire life is one great big shit show (including all the bullying, rapes, abuse from parents and teachers, having kids who don't even know my name, etc.), but it would take forever and doesn't help anything. The main point is that I don't really remember having any genuinely happy moments in life other than small things that happen once in a blue moon that I quickly lose interest in. I might get a bit excited to be able to try a food, watch a new movie or show, or a new song I found...but it's super rare, like a couple times a year sort of rare. Everything else is just constant misery, me feeling like a prisoner in my own skin and of a society I never gave permission to participate in. If I could change my circumstances, I would. I have literally exhausted just about every option that I could take to make my life better. I don't have any options except for saving up money for literally YEARS just to be able to make/record music in hopes I can make some sort of liveable income from that and isolate myself off grid until I have to do a music tour somewhere, and I can't wait that long and don't think my health could even allow me to do that, especially not 10 years from now. I am at my wits end. I am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me, is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery I feel. I am already thinking about how to plan my death, including figuring out where my cat will go, funeral options, exit plan, etc. I don't want to die TBH, but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it....except my cat.",1

My wife is supportive, my parents aren't in the picture concerning my emotional well-being, my friends are supportive, but I just want to die.  I want to end it.  I want to have no more of this.  I'm the common thread to all my problems and the one thing I haven't tried yet is removing myself from the equation.  I don't know if I could do it but I wish I could, because even though I've done everything right both in life and in trying to be good about self-care, I just can't stop feeling like I can't do anything good in the long run, I can't help my wife through her medical situations, and I can't hold up the burden of the house nor can I ask her to help because of said medical problems.  I can't logically think of a reason to stop myself, because what people say you're supposed to do just doesn't seem like it's working, and if I tell my therapist or psychiatrist that I'm in crisis, I'm going to have to go through all this again and I don't want to go through it anymore.

"I would like to start by saying that, although brief, I would need a million words to encompass the suffering I have endured in the past 3 years.I am currently at a stage where I am thinking about committing suicide daily, and frequently at that. I have even tried desensitizing to various methods, drowning etc by imagining them in depth. The level of suffering has increased to a stage where I believe that I could overcome the thought of hurting people that I love, because my suffering has greatly exceeded it. As you are probably well aware, the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring child's or family suicide is unbearable for them. The grief it would cause my mother, who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great.My problems may seem unbelievable, but I assure you everything I am about to tell you is the truth, not embellished in the slightest.When I was 17 I moved south in the UK to study. During that time I fell ill with mild depression and anxiety. Nothing out of sorts, just mills problems. Looking back now, it was probably the happiest time of my life. I lived well with 4 other people and managed socially and at university. I worked regularly at health shops and other retail shops.By the third year of my course I had experimented heavily with drugs. This was fine, I was fine. I smoked cannabis regularly and was often in a blissful state at the end of the day, no worries.I fell into homelessness after my degree ended like a daydream or a fever. I had many friends, this wasn't something to worry about. I relished in this until things became serious. I stayed at multiple people's flats for months on end, supplying them with food to help. I was oblivious to my immediate situation and when the last person I knew and a good year of sofa surfing had ended  I was stranded. By the time it had ended, I was only barely aware of the way I had been coping and that was with multiple opiates and cannabis. By the end of this period I had developed pretty severe social anxiety, characterised by sensorimotor OCD and an inability to communicate with new people without being completely aware of my expressions and movements.I had no option of my family helping me (already asked for way to much) and I turned to the local authorities. I was addicted to painkillers, unable to find a place to stay and lost. I eventually ended up in a hostel, and by all accounts was an absolute godsend. I lived with other temporarily homeless people and began working within the TJX industry. Now with relatively few people I knew, I didn't learn any of the things a person should try if thru felt depressed, angst or other side. Nobody taught my how to cope. I continued opiate abuse and eventually quit my job. I was offered a move on ""flat"" by BHT a local charity and it turned out to be the worst decision I could possibly have made.I would like to say now that this was BLISS compared to what I experience right now. Nothing could have prepared me for the physical and mental torture that was to come.This next section is something wrote about 4 months ago. I would like you to read this and then I may continue. I will mark the section.My progression from a functioning human being to a total social recluse who is both now chronically physically and mentally unwell was rapid. There will be no exaggeration or embellishment in my writing and everything I say is true. I'm glad I have found this place.Following my university course, and subsequent mental health issues and drug abuse, I went through anxiety to anxiety, chronic depression to psychosis. None of the things that I just mentioned, while serious, even touch how much I have suffered in the last year of my life due to my living conditions, random illness and unlucky circumstances. I truly didn't know what suffering was until this time.A few years after my degree I wasn't doing to well and I became homeless after I failed to find a house after I was sharing with others. I had a few minor friends that let me stay at their house, but nobody I was especially close to or a base in which I could reclaim my life. At this point I would like to mention, that while I do have family, I rarely have contact with them due to differences. At that point there is no circumstance where I would have been able to live at home.��Things progressed and I was declared homeless and sought hostels in a housing association in Brighton called BHT. I worked in retail and paid a portion of my rent and was getting better physically and emotionally and decided it was time to move. BHT had a scheme in place where they would help you find somewhere to live and one day when the support workers came over (as per usual on Wednesday), they laid out in the table what was to be the worst thing that ever happened to me.I was shown an 'experimental' housing project that consisted of shipping containers, much like those used in Holland for students. We were provided with artist impressions and it looked very clean. Best of all there we NO deposits or rent in advance and the full �657 rent was to be covered in full by the local housing benefit. I was immediately interested and began building a portfolio, which was required to sign up and and interview was to be taken.��I did all the necessary paperwork and was invited to a group meeting with other tenants who has signed up. When I arrived we were briefed for a couple of hours. We were told about the location, how we would pay electricity etc. I made a good impression an was accepted and all the arrangements were made to move in.This is when it all began.My first experience with the containers was an ugly one. Not only were they nothing like the artists impression, they were stuffed in front of a metal scrap yard and a pub which had just been demolished. I later found out that it was because of unsafe chemicals in the earth below the pub. These containers stuck out like a sore thumb and all I could think of when moving in was how much like prison it looked. Boy was I right. But I had no right to complain, I had nothing and nowhere to go, this was a lot better than living on the street, or so I thought.About a month after I moved in the antics began. I remember after night of drunks and drug addicts screaming, shouting a fighting courtyard. People smashing up parts of the containers and ripping off postboxes. The front of the containers was a showcase to the road and with both front and back being glass windows (the whole piece, with a door). Since there was no lock or fob system, people from Friday night and Saturday night poured in and caused havoc. It is situated just at the end of London road, probably the worst part of the city. There is no gap between the containers, they are all lined up like prison cells and stacked straight in top of each other with corrugated stairs.People would stare and take pictures in the day. and they would mock me and trample around my front door in the evening. Nobody's business was their own, if my neighbours were partying, everonr else had to put up with it and the stairs would fill with people jacking up or cracking up.��I distinctly remember feeling utterly hopeless and alone one night when a group of men came to the top floor and stood looking at the road from outside my door. They had obviously been on a night out and some were drunk. I remember the words outside my container. ""If I lived here I would jump of this floor and kill myself"" and preceded to laugh and joke about what low life's must be here.A year later and things were getting atrocious. Violent neighbours and their visiters ran rampage over the whole project. Every night was the worse than I could have imagine. Screaming, fighting, stabbings, rape and everything in between became normal. People would trash thier whole flats and scatter glass over the courtyard, and throw all of their rubbish in the bit just beside the containers. I would never have been able to dream up this madness. When I mean there were people screaming for hours on end, I mean it LITERALLY. Residents absolutely off their minds running round naked and shouting at the TOP of their lungs for hours and hours on end. Men assaulting women and there were cases of rape also. People flats were rushed for people seeking revenge for missed drug money. The place was completely out of control and the visits from the police and ambulances were so frequent, every one I heard go by I though was for the containers. This was EVERY day and night, no exception. Two people committed suicide.I have had people try my handle I was sleeping, try and break my door down and rush a flat I was speaking to a neighbour in looking to kill or beat to a pulp someone who has nothing to do with me. I had people asking me for money I. A daily basis and the walk up to my flat was hell with residents heckling me and wanting anything and everything from me.I made one friend there who was poet and wanted to help him record. He set up an anxiety talk in his flat for the good residents and we all made our case to the housing association and got many signatures for a petition to help with the project.We had frequent meetings with Andy Winter the CEO of BHT. We all spilled our hearts out about how bad it was living here and how security cameras a gate lock etc needs to be set up. Past the unrelenting crime and hellish neighbours was the cold. These containers got COLD in the winter and the insulation was awful and the heaters were pathetic little ceramic tiles that did nothing. The electricity was on a meter system and I was spending at least �30 just being warm. Bare in mind most of these people got about 120 every two weeks from the job centre. The housing association did NOTHING for about a year, when they finally implemented wooden insulation.I had a meeting with Caroline Lucas (MP of Brighton) personally in a food bank I would vistit and she was sympathetic but there was little she could do to help. A few residents practically declared war on BHT, and rightly so. They had ruined our lives and now where ignoring our cries for help, because of they did acknowledge the huge failure that the project was they would probably be shut down. I went to numerous newspapers whom ignored me as they were told they were not allowed to publish our stories. The only one which was actually published was only a few weeks after we moved in and was by my neighbourBy this point I was struggling badly with mental illness again. I was depressed and highly angst with daily panic attacks. It didn't help that the ventilation system was also poorly designed and I receive all of the drug fumes that come form the bottom 5 floors (I'm at the top). This included 'Spice' (now banned in the UK) smoke and I went to hospital frequently with chest pains. ��These fumes filled my flat all day long, so I spent a lot of time walking out of the house.This last year is when the hell occurred.��Someone moved in next door with severe anger issues. He would break the the flat into little pieces and blast his meter high speakers all day and night filed on speed and weed. I would wake up suddenly in the middle of the night sweating and my heart pounding, panicking due to sudden slams or smashes against my wall. There is barely any space between the walls. I began to have sleeping problems and insomnia that started worsening everything else. Complaints were made to no avail, they tried to evict him bit it didn't work and was a lengthy procedure.He wasn't the problem though, his visitor was. He was another tenant in the project and one that has caused problems before. What started out with a bit of neighbourly chatter tuned out to be the worst mistake of my life. I invited his the other neighbour in to play some video games and while we got along, I stopped inviting him in after it became apparent that he was an absolutely despicable human being. He recently had threatened to beat up a girl that I had to stop and was known to be causing issues, making people feel bad, but wasn't a major problem around the block. It became clear to me that this man was a secret demon. He began knocking door hard in the morning and after ignoring him for weeks I would eventually answer and tell him I don't want to see him. He would take this as an oppurtunity for an argument and harass me further. He deluded himself into thinking we were friends and became aggressive when I poiletly told him and Sinhalese to him that we were not. He thought he could do whatever around and in my flat. He stated trying my handle daily, sometimes even without knocking and this went on for months and months and months. I asked him to stop but he wouldn't. I told him my anxiety and insomnia was getting so bad due him and my other birth our that I am going insane. He carried on trying my handle and door daily, sometimes for hours on end. This was the worst. I shouted at him told him to leave numerous times but it carried on. If you have ever had someone debase you on such a level you will know how damaging that is. Someone who dictated when you sleep or wake and knows there is nothing you can do about it because they have nothing to lose and you do. I couldn't fight him because he would probably take it further. The sound of handles going stated to evoke a horrible physical response, one which would affect me for weeks on end.I couldn't call the police because that would put me in a dangerous situation for being a 'snitch'. There was no point in telling my housing association, there is nothing they could have done that wouldn't put me in a worse situation. Along with an already desperate situation and a very loud neighbour and another who took it upon himself to make my life a living hell I began to get seriously physically ill.
��
The present day:I began suffering with horrible fevers and viruses, symptoms that can only be described as like having the flu for months and months last year and they haven't stopped. I had about 10 bloods taken over the course of the year and the doctors can't figure out why I'm the state I am in. When I talk about this I can't stress enough how much I don't mean this lightly. I have had the Nora virus while withdrawing from diazepam and that didn't touch the physical suffering I have had EVERY day for the past year. Raised cortisol and adrenaline have left me incapacitated and completely ravaged my body, I know all of this stress is to blame. Coupled with dreadful hypervigilance and severe insomnia the suffering had been something I wouldn't wish on the most evil person. I began to lost my mind and become so derealised and depresonalized that I don't know how to concentrate or relax. I cant do anything I live like play instruments or listen to music without the content dear that someone might hear and start harassing me. The insomnia has been so bad I have been nearing hospitalization and the only reason I'm here today is that I managed to escape for a few months back to a friend in Gloucestershire. I have wanted to commit suicide for such a long time, but I never will because of how much it would hurt certain family members, even though I do not have contact with them often. Just to be clear, I DONT take alcohol or drugs and haven't for a long while. I eat a very healthy diet and exercise (force myself) daily and practice standing medidtation (pretty much impossible with the though of him being around)For the last 3 months the loud neighbour has been evicted, but the other one (the real problem) is still around. Every time I enter the gate is like the walk of the gauntlet, whether I will see him (he is often around) and have to deal with him. Having gone to my friends house in Gloucestershire I got back to find out I couldn't get back in because someone had tried to break in and snapped something in my lock. I am completely aggrophobic. I never see anyone than people at the supermarket and when I enter the gate I practically run up to my flat, stuff the curtains with cloths (so they can't see the lights when I have them on a night) and make barely any noise at night.��Someone else has moved in and the evil man has started going into his flat talking to him. I can't believe that that after a horribly loud neighbour who attached the evil man I'm the first place has now been evicted, the next one is also inviting him up and will probably soon give the man a reason to start knocking me again under the guise of friendship. I know he is around because I hear him shouting laughing outside my flat and I know he has knocked me once or twice in the last week.Just after Christmas, I did everything I could to move to a different county. I found the only place that I had a possibility of moving to was Bournemouth and an agency called DWP housing, due to their low fees and no deposit. I got a citizen's card and went there took the form in and they accepted my referencing. I was invited to view a flat when I received a call from the wan I was dealing with saying they wouldn't be corresponding with me any further. I found out that my housing association had been talking with her and told her I was in rent arrears, which I was not. I was in water debt and service charge with confused her. But she didn't ask me before sending the emails and ruined my chances.��
I have been to the council, the waiting list is unbelievably long, even with medical needs. Everywhere else I have been wants �1200+ in fees/deposit which I currently have no way of saving. Because of living in a hostel (even though I am 25) I am now entitled to the one bed rate of any country, unless I move into shared, in which case that privilege will be revoked.At this point I don't care where I go, I would happily take anywhere else in the country, whether it be a hostel or otherwise.��Every day is a battle to keeping on going and I have no one sleds to talk to.That's was what I wrote a while ago in a forum dealing with neighbours.Following the containers, I was able to get a loan and finally move out of them for good. I move to another part of the country, completely on my own, didn't know anyone at all.I since have developed a depersonlization disorder following the end of the containers. I became so detached, I may have walked on separate occasions for 20 odd miles a day for months. It occurred one night last Christmas when I returned from a visit to my family's house. It's an absolute miracle that I was able to leave, and I was so optimistic that I began doing everything in my power to make myself well. I eat a perfect diet, I exercise daily and do everything I can.The chronic insomnia stayed and the dissociative symptoms have reached a point where my awareness levels are very worrying and borderline insane. I spend whole days trying to take on various stimulus took regain awareness. I try to take in sounds a sights, but everything has lost meaning. I can't appreciate a beautiful lake or a song, because I'm not here or there, I'm nowhere. I feel like some sort of  blood supply has been cut to important regions of my mind that I can only beg for help about.The fevers randomly come and go, even away from the containers and most days I wake up feeling physically awful. I cannot control my body temperature and wake up, I feel flu like again and again, which is how it began before.My muscles ache unbearably all day, I have to walk slow and when I exercise I do it out of fear of death.My body is simply fucked and no doctor can explain it. I clearly have something wrong but it can't be explained, probably because it is so complex or a virus so deep, it can't even be found. I have had over 20 blood tests in the last year. Around two weeks ago I developed a very loud tuning in my ears. It is severe tinnitus that is making everything I do meaningless. The last thing that I had in the world after moving was peace and quiet at night and that had been taken from me. There is no sight of it going and it didn't follow acoustic trauma. I can see myself rapidly declining in the past few weeks. This is becoming a joke. I have begun to think that this is some sort of test. I am being referred to a new psychiatrist,a sleep clinic and the community psychiatric team in my area and hopefully a neurologist.I now have no friends and speak to family maybe once a month.I exist only because I don't want to hurt those who may feel pain from my death. I love my 97 year old grandmother too much to burden her in her last year's and my mother would be distraught.I am approaching a stage where my suffering is so great, that there would have been numerous times that if I'd had access to a gun, I would definitely would have killed myself. The fear of drowning, hanging or falling is great.I want to die, I want others to accept that I want to die. I have been looking into possible euthanasia. I am close to the end.If you have read that all, I thank you that is all I ask.",1
"I've never been good at anything and doubt I ever will be. Always living in the shadows of smart, talented, beautiful people who actually have a future. Sometimes I hate them, most of the time I just hate myself. Out of everyone I knew I'm the biggest loser of them all. Everything is always about money and sex and it's bullshit. I'm just some dirty poor, how dare I have opinions, hopes or aspirations. I can never have independence and I feel like I've been set up to fail. Someone like me doesn't deserve to continue to take up resources better spent somewhere else. I wish I could give my worthless life to someone who belongs. I hope I find the courage to finally end my pathetic life.",1
"I need help. My thoughts are getting worse and worse. But I don't know what will happen with my wife and kids. Will my kids be taken away if CPS finds out I went to a facility?

I would never hurt my wife or kids.",1
"For the last few years, I've been struggling really hard. Plainly and simply, I hate absolutely everything I am. I've lost all my energy and drive and I don't care about anything I used to. I'm supposed to be a senior in college this year, but I got expelled this past year because I didn't care enough to go to any of my classes. To pay my bills now, I work full time on 3rd shift and I hate my job. To stay awake on the job, I take caffeine pills and they give me really bad anxiety. And the work is really draining, so I spend all of my free time sleeping. None of my friends want to hang out with me anymore because I'm such a piece of shit and I cancel plans all the time to sleep. I used to love to play jazz guitar and I don't have any time or energy to play anymore. My apartment is a complete mess, and I don't care enough to clean it. I can't fucking live like this anymore. I hate knowing how much of a fuck-up and a failure I am. I pissed my future away, so now I have to do something about it. I plan to kill myself sometime this month, if not as early as next week. I plan to take Tylenol PM and alcohol. I'll get drunk off my ass first, and then 16 pills should be enough to kill me from acetaminophen overdose. I have all the shit for it in my apartment already. I've been thinking about this for the past year or so and I've weighed all of my options. I know this is the right move. I thought about all the people who know me and I've wondered if any of them would miss me. I don't think they will. I know they won't. At least not in the long term. I'm just another failure that will fade into obscurity with time. It's better to off myself now than to keep burdening the world with my existence. I've come to realize that some people in this world just aren't cut out to play the game of life.",1
"I'm 23 years old living with my mom and over 2k in debt from medical bills. I've been healthy all my life until I was 22 when I was diagnosed with a fungal infection. Some call it a candida overgrowth and it's been haunting me since January. Everyday has been a struggle with feeling tired and this brain fog 24/7. I'm starting to get answers to cures but all the ""cures"" have potential of causing other serious health issues. I don't enjoy activities like I used to and I'm starting to lose my friends because it seems like I'm pushing them away but in reality I just can't find the energy to hang out with them. I've been having suicidal thoughts often for about 3 or 4 months now because i'm tired of the suffering. On top of this I was raised by a sociopath and suffered a lot in my childhood and my biggest fear is becoming like my insane dad. This brain fog i've been suffering from feels like it's making me lose my mind and making me feel more open to putting a stop to my life. If anyone knows a natural cure to candida overgrowth please let me know as I won't be able to afford many more doctor visits. I'm not looking for sympathy or ""I can relate"" replies I just want answers :(",1
Contemplating suicide every night is not how I want to live. Don't know how to fix it. I hate myself.,1

"Forbthe paste year, my life has been a blur. I have had no interests except video games. Video games have been the only thing stopping me from suicide. I dont have any friends, i am overweight and my parents are the biggest problem. They are always putting me down, they call me a loser, a failure, pathetic, a disappointment, a dumbass, lazy, every day. Today my mum took away my computer with all my games, she said go get a life you loser. Videogame have Been the thing keeping me together for so long. Now that they are gone, i think i am going to do it",1

All I wanted to do was to just be happy. And I was but now I'm not... so what is the point anymore everything is failing around me and I want to quit. I hate my life and don't care about it anymore, I just think everyone would be happier if I was gone. I have no energy to do anything. I have no fight left in me, and gonna take some pills tonight. Hopefully I dont wake up......",1

"I don't know if this will even help. I don't even know why I'm thinking about coming to Reddit with this. I've been very open about this stuff, and I think that has helped me, so here we go.  I've been super stressed (but I don't want to sound whiney). I think it's just time. I don't ever see myself coming out of this funk. When I try to talk to friends/family/my Dr. they all just get mad. I'm on vacation from work this week, so maybe I'll just enjoy it, and enjoy my plans with my friends and family and just end it on the last day. That's just my current thoughts. Maybe sharing this will help me in some way. Who knows?  Just wanted to get that out there. ",1
"I have a friend who has given up. She's been in abusive relationships, self-harmed, had serious body issues her whole life. A few months ago she was spiked and raped.
She is seeing a therapist for the rape but they don't know the full extent of her feelings, she thinks if she tells someone they'll lock her up or make her quit her job, tell her family or maybe worse do nothing at all.
She doesn't want help, she doesn't want me to help because she doesn't see any reason to keep on living.
I'm really scared, I'm trying fucking everything on google but she's so set on giving up I don't know what to do. I've told her I'm here to listen but she doesn't want to talk, she doesn't want to burden me. I just really need some help on what to do.
To make things worse I now live 3 hours away so I cant help her in person.
Any advice would be so endlessly appreciated, thanks",1

"Freshman year of high school I was on track to being valedictorian. I could have gone to an Ivy league school, I had such a bright future ahead of me. Of course I fucked all that up. I went to UCR because it was the only ""good"" college that accepted me. I had no idea that I could go to a cc and transfer to UCLA, I didn't even know that was an option. My GPA sucks, my social life is nonexistent, this is the rest of my life now. Everyone has moved on without me. I'm a disappointment to my family and everyone I know. This isn't the life I wanted. It's too late to be someone great, to accomplish all of my goals. I had so much potential. I was a ""smart"" kid. I don't want an ordinary life. What's therapy going to do? Help me cope and make me settle? I don't want to live this life anymore. I've wanted to die for years. Lol I procrastinated on homework and suicide it looks like. I don't know what I'm waiting for. I'm never going to have the life I dreamed for myself. I'm such a nothing.",1
"19 y/o male in college, struggling in school, poor mental condition overall, fully lonely (not in physical state, but in state of mind), awful luck with the opposite sex, nothing that genuinely makes you happy, bleak outlook on the future.i feel this state is pretty common among people my age in school, is anyone like that on here?",1
"I have an anger issue, and a carelessness issue. Usually I can keep both of them in check, but there's been a perfect storm between events insider and outside work. I keep escaping by having unrealistic violent fantasies about the people I run into. I hate living in the city, everyone is so fake and out for themselves. I fear that one day I will lose control on another, so maybe it's just best to take care of myself first.",1
"At what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option? I've had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now, but I never really considered actually doing it until quite recently. I'm so far down the drain that I don't think it's humanly possible to obtain the life I want, a somewhat normal life, anymore.I'm a 23 year old guy with avoidant personality disorder who doesn't have any friends, never worked a job, and never had any sort of relationship with anyone. On top of that, I just failed college for the second time in 5 years because I'm too depressed and anxious to deal with handling the work and being around people all day. I have absolutely no skills or anything to offer to any individuals or society. I just play video games and listen to music all day because that's the only thing that doesn't cause me anxiety.I hate myself and I hate the fact that I hate myself. I can see the innate beauty in every other person on this planet except for myself. A lot of people feel and act the way I do and I wouldn't call them worthless, so why must I do so when it comes to me? I feel this hollow yet dense pain in my chest that won't go away. The pain comes from the realization that I am completely and utterly worthless, and nothing will ever change that because I was born with the wrong genes and made stupid decisions my entire life.Medications, therapies, and ""getting out there"" haven't helped in the slightest. In all honesty, I'm worse off for having tried them because I used to have hope that there was something out there that could help me. Failing over and over again has crushed my soul to the point of no return. I'm starting yet another CBT program in a few weeks, one which is way out of my price range and will leave me in moderate debt, and I can't help but feel that this is my final hope. I can't keep doing this crap anymore. I'm either going to get better soon, or I'm going to die, there will not be an in-between anymore.",1
"This is my life, It's a long sad story but one I must tell to someone. I was born a middle kid into a middle class family. My parents we're my first abusers. My Dad was an alcoholic. He beat me and my brother. Some nights were good and he just listen to music. My mom was not much better. She was abuse by my dad but she abuse him emotionally and financially. They were bad for each other.  Around the third grade I was diagnosed with autism. The testing was very traumatic. This was when I first experience gender dysphoria. In the waiting room the only VHS that worked was Alice in Wonderland. I wanted to be Alice. She could handle her new world and I couldn't handle mine. My parent just filled me with pills from than till high school. The pill made me slow and fat. It was easier to dope me up than to be a parent. This lead to me getting up to 400 LBS and I develop boob. (I'm a guy) I've spent my whole adult life trying to get fit because of this. It's one of my biggest failures. At 17 I was raped. My friends got me drunk and payed a girl to have sex with me. It happen at a party. I've only told my therapist. I still can't talk about. There's no proof left too, so one one would believe me. Collage was a failure to. I didn't know I had BPD and depression. I still didn't talk about being rape. I let it build up inside me. I than met my Ex. She was great at first than became emotionally,verbally, and sexually abusive. I hide her from friends and family. I spend the next three years in deep denial. This come out in a phone sex and cam girl addiction. It'd been a year and I can't stop. I've spend $10,000.  There's no coming back from all this. I'm stuck at a dead end job. My life is forfeit. There's no coming back from all this.",1
Two of them are scared of how'd I'd react to what they would say and one of them was hesitant on telling the counselor.And this other girl... she's afraid that I'm some sort of stalker or molester.

"i accidentally sexually assaulted one of my very good friends. i was in a terrie headspace and i went to go kiss her; she resisted physically and verbally and eventually gave in. the entire time i kept asking myself why i was doing this and kept apologizing to her, but i kept going. oh god, i wish i didn't keep going. i started kissing her neck and her thighs and pulled down her shirt. i realized what i had done and left, profusely apologizing.she wants nothing to do with me now and i understand that, but i can't grt rid of the guilt. i feel like everyone hates me now (with due reason) and i've been going back and forth through intense crying fits and wanting to kill myself. i never have enough energy to carry it out, but im thoroughly convinced that it could happen by accident and i wouldn't stop it. yesterday i was taking off my sweatshirt and it tugged on my neck, constricting airflow very momentarily, and something in my mind just told me to keep going. i felt so at peace. i'm so scared of myself and what i have become every time i tell someone what i did in an attempt to figure out how to help myself i know they are judging me and distancing themselves from me because im absolutely fucking horrendousi've been going to class less and less and crying more and more and i dont know what to do with myselfi think suicide has been a long time coming. i used to strangle myself with scarves when i was like 7 or 8 whenever i disappointed my parents because i felt like a disaster. maybe i'll be at peace. maybe she'll be at peace too. she won't see me walking around anymore. she'll be comfortable. i want her to be comfortable. i just want her to be fucking happy. she deserves the whole world. she deserves the sun, the moon, and the stars. she doesn't deserve the pain i caused her. so maybe if i don't exist anymore, her pain will go away too.",1

"I've struggled with the idea of being alive, and wanting to be alive for a while now. I recently realized that I don't want help. I just want to not be alive. The only reason I would seek help is so that I don't hurt my loved ones. I've attempted to kill myself before, but I can't even begin to imagine what sort of pain and isolation that they would go through if I actually did it. I don't want them to ever feel how I've felt, but I just don't think that they understand how I feel. Even when I'm not feeling as depressed, the thought of not being alive is  so appealing. I've always done only what others expect of me, but I've never really wanted more for my life anyway. I've tried therapy, a few medications, none of it has been right for me. If they only knew how painful it is for me to be alive, maybe they wouldn't be so insistent on me trying to get help. I just can't wait for a medication or therapy to work, that could take months or years. Every single day, every hour, every minute is so painful, I just can't do it anymore.",1

"Hello, so I have commented here as I am a shy/anxious junior in high school with social anxiety, so like I got rid of the crap on my face. I'm worried if others will say, like I did last year and this white girl named Emma said and yelled""Holy shit you shaved!"" and everyone was looking at me. I don't want anyone to find out I shaved, and I unwanted facial hair I have bits of it, I don't want it to fucking grow, I hate how I look, I didn't ask for this shit on my face. Just because I'm ""growing up"" doesn't mean I want it, and a lot of people my age don't have this crap. They're gonna be like ""you look different."" I get so nervous because of that. How do I stop this fucking growth? It's insane, my dad told me to shave once every week to prevent the hair from growing. I want it to stop, so I can stop it makes me uncomfortable, I literally don't want this, please. I'm a south asian-Pakstani. I got into a huge feud with my parents and i cried a lot and my mom said"" people who cry are like 4 year old kids like your cousin yunus"" ""you put all the stress on yourself, and it is your fault"" i told her to respect my boundaries, and ill respect yours i shaved and so she got mad and said ""don't hide your blanket"" i was going to put it away anyways downstairs but i told her about my self harming problem and how you told me i ""joke about suicide"" and other past stuff she assumed i was ""joking about"" and she said ""i'm sorry i didn't realize that, i don't know what i said suicide is a joke, and you're not alone i used to have suicidal thoughts myself"" i cut myself so hard because i was sad i'm sorry i broke it i suck ass and anyhoo, when i was driving she told me that"" she got fired from her davis job, and she's been trying to find a job for 7 years, and i do care about you, i tell you about religion because it helps me, and allah will help everyone and everyone will go back to him, i believed in allah"" ""allah knows our strengths and weaknesses, and please don't suffocate yourself with a pillow, i put the blame on you because you want it to be, i'm not giving you pity, attention"" i'm fucking tired man i was screaming/crying at her and my dad came in the closest and told my mom to ""leave me alone let him calm down"" i said i ""ruined things, and clearly you guys don't love me and care about me, i self harm(shows my cuts) and i tried to suffocate myself with a pillow, i feel like this is all my fault and i'm alone"" she got all shocked i told her i might plan to go to ditch school tomorrow or at least a few days and she told me ""not to, have faith in allah he will help you"" i told her"" i don't believe in god, and i hate religion"" and she said ""i used to think that too, and when i had faith in allah he helped solve my problem while allah did have let out the bad devil, he does good and you know how you write in a journal on about how stressed you are? you should do it"" I am planning to tell her I want to talk to my school psychologist, but she keeps suggesting me Muslim male and female counselors though saying female Muslim would be better. She said ""regular psychologists aren't going to be as helpful, it takes time to get them because you need a referral."" But, what if I do the school one?",1
"Every day everything becomes more and more difficult. Every night I lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head, all the thoughts are so disjointed, unclear, as if I can't think properly. The only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming. Every night I resolve to kill myself in the morning. Then it's morning. It's not that having slept on it things are better, it's more that I've come down from being past the point of being able to cope to just on the edge of my capability to cope. I go through my awful day, it's evening again and the whole process starts againOne day sooner or later, I feel like sooner, I won't wake up like that. I'll wake up still committed to the idea of killing myself. I cannot remember ever being happy or even just okay. I'm 25 now and I can remember crushing unhappiness going back at least to when I was 15. When I was in school I could look to the idea of 'I'll go to university and things will be different, I'll meet new friends, it'll be a new start'. When I was at university and that obviously didn't work out I could think the same about finishing university. Now though there is next stage to look forward to and even if there was I know it'd end up being no better.  Life now is deciding to kill myself in the evenings, deciding against that in the mornings until one day I don't. I have nothing good in my life. I have no real friends (and no clue on how to make them), I've never had a meaningful relationship (It's quite difficult letting people close when like this), even my family don't like me that much (the feeling is mutual). Sure I've got a job, but the thought of going to my workplace every day makes me feel physically ill and it's a dead end job that's going nowhere. What is the point of living if all living is is a constant fight to have the will to live? I might as well give up now",1
Why do you want to die?,1
I just lost the last person I care about. I'm done. The pain is to much now.,1
"Hello world,My name will be kept anonymous. I'm 13, and I'm fucking done with life. I've tried it out, got bored, wanna move on to the next thing. Death. I only have three friends, including my mother. My father is dead. Everyone at school dislikes me, and I couldn't care less if they did or not.I'm not here to say I will. I'm here to say I might. So please, gimme some words, Reddit.God knows my therapist can't.",1
"I guess I just wanted to date in high school, or at least before 22. I've always been a hopeless romantic guy (emphasis on the hopeless) and I've always went way overboard when it came to getting crushes and naturally, I've scared everyone I ever had a chance with off long before I did anything like dating them. Now I'm 80 pounds overweight and depressed and anyone I find attractive is way out of my league at this point. That's probably my fault too though, I could date a girl I find unattractive but would that be fair to either of us? I'd rather rot to be honest. Not to mention I have no idea how to talk to women, I'm worse than the classic nerd paraded on television (ironically one I used to call over exaggerated haha...) and I stumble, fail to make eye contact, and forget what I'm saying constantly even when I have no romantic intentions. I'm pathetic I guess, and one way or the other life has helped me fuck myself so I guess I won't die a virgin after all. After 1 near attempt earlier this year I think I'm ready, hopefully I won't pussy out this time and actually get the gun. The problem is if I get the gun and don't go through I won't have enough money to live so I'm too poor to kill myself hahaha. I know this is a stupid reason to kill myself, and I do have others but I was just focusing on this one tonight in particular but it doesn't matter because I'll be dead either way if all goes according to plan. Sorry for those of you that read this mildly depressing rant, was just looking for a place to fulfill my narcissism.",1
"I don't know, maybe deep deep down I'm lonely and I really do want help. I don't know how to ask for help. As long as I can remember I've been completely non verbal about my problems, like I literally can't speak truthfully about it in real life, because I was so afraid of it being used to hurt me in some way.I feel very determined to die at this point, and I have a plan that I've practiced, but I don't want to be alone when I decide to carry out my plan. I know I can't write a note, but I do want to talk to somebody. It's just too hard to say anything to somebody who can see me and act upon me or who has met me.",1
"I'm really fucking unhappy. I do take the effort to try and enjoy life, but it is just not happening. It's just strife after hardship after tribulation, and I don't reeeeally see the return in all the effort put into it. It's just the logical thing to do for me; just kinda wanna play games that aren't out yet or experience new music- those things are probably the only thing making me hesitate.",1
"I am 27 and have tried everything to fix my brain. I have tried talk therapy, self help books, self help apps, eating healthy, exercise, sunlight, etc. yet I never feel better and always feel a darkness around me that never goes away. I am unattractive, shy and have no friends and wasted my entire life. I cannot accomplish anuthing, all I've ever wanted to do was photography and went to school for art but I suck at it and now am stuck in retail. Everyone in life has moved on and i am thinking of just ending everything. ",1
"Hello! Im going to apologize in advance for any errors in what i'm about to type.I am 15 years old, in Highschool. Ive been depressed for over a year now, and nothing has helped me long term. The only person who cares about me wont even speak to me anymore. She would always be there for me whenever she noticed I was sad, and I basically humiliated myself when I told her that I loved her.She told me that im not her type, and I respected that and I moved on, we continued to be friends, but she started to purposefully make me feel a certain way when she didnt want to deal with me. She would usually just either do something that would make me feel guilty, or just avoid me and say that its for the better. But she would always apologize right after she did it, and tell me that she was sorry for doing this to me. She told me that she didnt mean to do this to me, and that shell feel at fault if I ever kill myself. I told her that I forgive her, and that all she has to do is be normal around me and she wont have to worry about hurting me. Months of me slowly losing everything I know and love passed, we both went to highschool, and over the summer I adopted the habit of cutting myself. It was the only way I could cope without anyone to talk to. My mother found out after 1 whole month of me cutting. She didnt offer any support, she just told me to stop because it would ruin her image. I didnt stop. After 1 week I messaged my friend about what im going through. She sent me an email in the first week of school telling me that she doesnt want to help me anymore, and that I need therapy. Ever since then, she wont even aknowledge that I exist. I have tried to ask her if we could talk things through, no reply. I sit at her table with the rest of my friends every day, everyone just acts like I dont exist. I have literally cried before and not one person asked if I was okay. Sometimes, one of my ""friends"" will make a ""joke"" along the lines of ""Why are white people so bipolar""- then he says some other crap that I will not repeat. (Yes, I am white, and besides 2 other people at my table, everyone is asian.) Its obvious that they are talking about me. They make fun of me a lot, its screwed up though because I have known them for all of middle school and some of highschool. Yet they act like im just some piece of trash.Though I said my friend acts like I dont exist, she will say hi to me everyone now and then, or sometimes she will ask how I am doing in school, all adding to my confusion. She is honestly the only reason I want to live, yet she is slowly just trying to forget me. But she is not judgemental of me, like everyone else is. That is why I still hold on to her. Well enough of my life story. Im honestly just planning on killing myself soon, its all just become too much to handle... I have attempted suicide before, but I ended up thinking of my friend and stopping because I wouldnt want to hurt the person who means so much to me. I told myself that if she doesnt respond to me in a week, then that means she doesnt care about me. Then, I will have nothing holding me back. I have already written everyone a suicide note, and its all readly available to be sent with a click of a button. Im just ready to die.  I know I sound pretty pathetic, but tell me what I havent already heard before by every single person I used to be close to.Well, goodbye everyone! It may be today, or tomorrow or the end of the week. But when ever I do it, I want to thank anyone who truely cares.(Sorry for so much reading.)",1
"Everyone I ever trusted has forgotten me, no one cares, goodbye everyone, ill be gone in 6 hours and 35 minutes",1
"Last week I drove out to a local suspension bridge. It's in the middle of a park which is closed for the season, and doesn't receive a lot of traffic. The bridge itself stands 232 feet above the waters below, which would be ample distance to reach terminal velocity, allowing a quick and certain death. As I looked down to the river below, I thought about just how many people have been where I am. How many of them could use just one person to just listen, not judge or tell them how to ""fix"" their lives. But just listen and allow for them to spill their guts and get that god awful pain out. Somebody that would just make them feel like their pain was legitimate, and not just a problem that could be easily solved. If only someone would just be there.As I started climbing over the railing, and hung with only my own trembling fingers separating me from a release from my own existential hell, I had another thought. I am someone. It made me pause and wonder, What if I could give others what I, myself could never find? Maybe I could do some good in the world after all. I'd have purpose. Meaning. I drove back to town and I promised myself that I would do just that. If I can't express my own misery, I can at least help others with theirs. If any of you want to talk, feel free to message me. I can't promise I can help, but I promise you I will listen, and do all I can to help you feel a little better.",1
"My medications aren't helping, and my normal fleeting thoughts of suicide are becoming heavy. I grabbed a rifle earlier and made sure I could use it with the barrel against my head. Please say something to me. Anything. The anxiety is making my throat swell shut and my eyes keep welling up. I feel like my prayers aren't being heard and the thought of tomorrow disturbs me.",1
"Your observations are very correct. Shut off the phone or computer, go outside, get some fresh air, and meet some new people. ",1
"I tried everything. I got a job, started a study programme and I work out regularly and eat healthy. I got over 80% of my anxiety and everything (except of love) is working out right now. But I still feel pain I almost cannot handle. And yes, it's physical pain like a broken leg just in my fucking head and its much worse than an injury. I tried it all really. I went to therapy, medication, everything. I still relapse regularly. I cannot do this. I hope I have enough energy to buy a rope tomorrow. I wont even write a suicide note cause I dont feel like it. I'm so fucked up...",1
"I'm 17 and currently in college, this post will most likely look like a mess as I am not the best with this sort of stuff but oh well. I struggled through school with things such as concentrating,thinking,writing/getting thoughts out and I guess I have social anxiety but never been told that by a professional (only by a close friend) and I have been feeling like shit for at least 2 years now and it is getting to the point of where I don't know what to do now.When was in school (Primary/secondary) they had never contacted my parents about that nor did they actually properly help me but they did put me in all the lowest classes and I would get more help near exams and go into different rooms.. But they never asked for me to be tested for anything like learning difficulties or such so I've just had to deal with feeling stupid and it feels like my fault but oh well I guess. Each week is like a loop that I am stuck in and it just goes on and on and it feels so pointless. We all live to grow old and then die so what is the point of getting a job that will probably be shit for me because I'm not exactly the smartest person out there.Most days I wake up with the feeling of being tired but not like I need more sleep just the feeling of not wanting to move or where I just don't see the point and can't be arsed to do anything, I get the thoughts of being able to float away or disappear (I say that a lot to my close friend and it probably sounds so fucking stupid)I also get the thoughts of why do I get to bitch about how I am feeling so down but there are people who are going through so much worse than me because its all in my head and I need help but I want to end it all so bad but im too scared to fucking hang myself.",1
"Growing up, I got bullied and teased. Ive always been the kid trying to be in the in crowd, trying to look cool, trying to be popular. I tried so hard that my best friend in elementary school doubled as my bully. (She wasn't my only bully) I never physically got it but man were those kids mean. I got bullied literally from 5 years old to college. Everywhere I go... it turns into some form of bullying. At work, my bosses.. or even coworkers. I once got into a physical altercation with my roommate because I wanted her to stop using my as a verbal punching bag.  I was an asshole too so don't feel too sorry for me. I once told my now friend that I heard screams in my head whenever I looked at her hair. I know, what the fuck is wrong with me right? This was like middle school. I bullied this one girl from elementary school to senior year of high school. We are now friends, I sincerely apologized after we graduated and never bullied her again. I am no longer a bully..I grew up my whole life thinking I'd be a rapper and when I got famous I'd say FUCK ALL YOU HOE ASS BULLIES, FUCK YOU!! Or maybe I'd forgive them and just motivate some other kids who got bullied. Idk, I wanted to be an inspiration and change the world. I wanted to be like Kanye West. My favorite rapper of all time. But even Kanye broke my fucking heart..he used to be for the black community and struggles and uplifting black people but all he cares about is money now and clothes and rich people bullshit. Im a fucking virgin. Im overweight. Im a 22 year old virgin and im a girl!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK.. I never even kissed a guy.. other than one time in 8th grade during truth or dare. ..until recently. I was on the train coming home from work and this guy asked if he could kiss me. I guess I looked rougly decent that day. He probably had low standards though bcuz he wasnt that great looking either. Anyway.. dude asks to kiss me and I say why the fuck not because YOLO right? I have NO friends... My phone broke recently and I realized that I didnt even need it because I dont need it... The only person who texts me is me is my younger sister who's 19.. I had a great best friend of 8 years. It would have been 9, but I treated her like utter shit and I touched her in her sleep. What kind of fucking asshole does that to someone??? To make matters worse, she's straight and had no feelings for me whatsoever. We talked about me liking her and her not liking me before I did it. I hate myself straight up. I apologized to my friend many times, she said she's not angry but she doesnt want to be friends anymore. I completely understand but I just hate myself for this shit now.. Its embarrassing, everything. Im tired of this life. I dropped out of college because Im bipolar and have ADD also.. so school is fucking hard and I flunked 5 semesters. I shouldve graduated by now but Im 2 years behind.. maybe more.Ive never been in a relationship.My mom had a talk with me last night and told me that nobody celebrates failure. And she was telling me why people dont like me. This may sound bad, but she was coming from a good place and out of concern, her tone may not translate because of the way Im writing it.",1
No matter what I post here I know I'll feel like a fool for it ... I mean .... nothing will change . My life has always been this way. And being a guy it's not so easy to find someone to talk to about my feelings .  I just want a change in my life . Or I'm ending it in a year from now,1
"Hometown friends have given up even replying to me now.The last thing I was told was ""Complaining won't get you anywhere.""

I look like a bum compared to an average kid at my school, people keep talking shit about me more and more, yet a family member can drop +$800 on a phone like it's nothing. I know I keep sounding like a dick here but my school bag is falling apart, my shoes I have to wear everyday are falling apart, and my 2 pairs of jeans are ripped. (probs. because I'm a fatass, but whatever.)I already think people are talking shit about me, but when they actually say it to my face...All of this is out of my control. I can't do shit about it.I can't imagine waiting all this out until next year. I've been waiting so long for a little ounce of hope but nothing has happened for so long, what's the point?..

"The lights are going out.I've lived with depression and anxiety for 4 years now. My first public' panic attack I had was my sophomore year of college. My girlfriend was hanging out in my room as I started bawling on the phone with my parents. That was the first time anyone had seen me cry in years, seen really any emotion out of me. I started to get nihilistic when I went into college. I started to see the world, as I put it, realistically, or what I thought was realistic. I started seeing the world as I wanted to see it, as a shithole. Pointless. A waste of my time and effort. That's when I started to question why?As a  junior in college I still struggle to find that Why in my life, that purpose everyone else seems to have, the drive that gets them out of bed in the morning, that will to live. I just don't think I have it anymore. Sure, I've gotten help and have seen a multitude of doctors and specialists, but you can't be honest with them. They see that will to live as the only way to keep your freedom. I can't tell anyone I want to hurt myself or I want to jump off the balcony of a 15-story building or I'm going to get put away, locked up in a nice padded room and fed drugs so I don't kill myself. That makes no sense. If I want to die, let me die. I just don't see the point in it all anymore, going to classes is a struggle in the morning, I even have a hard time going out to get drunk and do drugs. I don't have the motivation to get fucked up as a 20-year-old guy. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I look myself in the mirror anymore? Why can't I just be a normal guy? What is broken in my head?",1
"I don't want to die. I don't want to go, I don't want to leave all of the people I care about behind. But I feel like that's where I'm headed. It's that same feeling when you wake up in the morning and the bed is nice and comfy. Maybe you are even a bit sick. You tell yourself ""I don't want to get up. I don't want to go to class. I don't want to go to work."" But no matter how many times you tell yourself this, you know that you are eventually going to get up and do what needs to be done.I feel like that right now. Part of me has taken it as an inevitability and is waiting for the time. I find myself making lose plans. Part of me is fighting back, trying to throw up as many safeguards as I can.  When the suicidal part is in control, I find myself slipping in messages of ""help me"" into conversations, but nobody ever listens and nobody comes to help. When my rational mind is in control, I find myself unconsciously making small preparations.This war in my head is really tearing me apart. I can't do anything at times, I just lie/sit there or mechanically go through whatever needs to happen. We had a big career fair at my school this week and I couldn't even manage to go there because the depression hit so hard, even though I know that I need to go because I need to get a job for the next summer. If I even make it to next summer.  I'm not making a positive change in the world and my existence only hurts people. Any good I do like with the guy from last week I just feel like I'm attoning for the terrible things that I've done. but I know that some things about me won't and can't change, so I know I will hurt people in the future.I'm writing this as someone with some sense of control right now. I know that all of these thoughts, including the suicidal ones, are mine. It is me and I am it. I just don't know how much longer I get to be myself. ",1
"Im gonna turn 24 tomorrow, and I feel like im a waste of time and resources for my parents and society. In my 24 years ive contributed absolutley nothing to anyone or done anything that brings value to anyone. Everyday despite how hard it is for me to gather my myself to get up out of bed, i do it for my parents because I dont want to disappoint them any further and I try, but everynight i get home a failure. All my peers and collegues are amazing and moving up in the world, have careers, finished uni, have partners and are loving life and everyday im going downhill, failing university, not performing well at work and im my social life.Before when people used to ask me what i want to do in 5 years time, I responded with some optomistic bullshit where I would run my own business or some shit but now if anyone ask me, I cant even see past the next day let alone 5 years.I know I have amazing family, and I have a number of good friends and thats the only reason I keep getting up in the morning to try again. But if i was to describe myself i would say I am useless, worthless, unmotivated, lazy and a terrible person but most of all just downright pathetic. Looking at everything rationally im really lucky and privledged to have so many blessings and i feel so guilty like an overwhelming sense of guilt. I read though other peoples post and im amazed at how strong some people are. Im sorry that i cant be as strong as them.Back in primary school im grade 5 people used beat me up, throw rocks and shit and a lot of other shit and i remember holding knife to my throat in the kitchen fuck i wish that i just ended it then. Most days I think about how I should kill myself and how make it look an accident which has minimum disruption to my friends and family. I think ive worked out a way, and ive written a note and now I think im writing this out hoping for a sign to stay. I dont want to die but it just hurts like Im constantly in pain and it hurts so bad. My heart has this constant sinking feeling and my left arm is just numb. I want to just make it stop please. Sorry for the stupid and selfish post. Idk feel free to ignore it or whatever.",1
"I've always felt so ""out of place"". I'm not one of those cool kids that everyone loves, I'm that awkward kid that sits at his desk and doesn't do shit in fear of judgement. I'm so worried about what people think about me, it's overtaking my life. I can't do things I'm passionate about in fear of being ""weird"". On top of that I seem to have gotten everything shitty. I'm clumsy as fuck and god has that got me into so many situations. Not only that but I suffer from OCD. Other than that, I'm so fucking shy I can't talk in front of people. Getting called on in class makes my brain shut down, and forces me to seem like a dumbass. My family relationships are breaking apart, me feeling farther and farther away. I don't have people to talk to -- rather I'm to shy to talk to anyone about my problems. I don't give a shit about myself. I don't want to make other people deal with my problems, i dont want other people to care for me, or feel for me. If i get hurt i feel more embarrassed that i got myself hurt than trying to treat myself. I dont care anymore, so whats the point? I dont need a future, i wont matter, i dont need to matter. My life was a mistake and it should stay that way, right? I just want to end it all, no point in keeping on going because I don't have anything to go to. I dont have motivation, goals, anything. The only reason i keep going is because i dont want others to be hurt if i disappear, but what if they dont care? No one likes me, i dount they will care. I have a few friends, but to them im just a side friend. They wont care. My one best friend might care, but he can just replace me. Not like im original in anyway. I dont even know why im posting this. For pity? For hope that somehow i can stop this? I'm going to end it soon, is there a small part of me that doesnt want to? Why does life have to be so complicated. Atleast it will be over soon.",1
"For a lot of complicated reasons, that are hard to describe because it's all due to cultural reasons , I am feeling the overwhelming urge to end it. I am stuck as the person inbetween my father and my fianc̩ fighting over cultural norms as I am marrying outside of my culture.

Sometimes I feel like it would be easier to just drive into a wall. My father is constantly stressed and angry because I am marrying outside, my mother is in the hospital , my sister currently is upset with me because I chose to help my fianc̩ with somthing over my family.

"The suicide hotline has me on hold so I want to post here. Basically I don't understand why this happens, but I hate being with people. I hate being alone more. So I'm always sad to varying degrees. I don't like hanging out with people right now cause I gained 25-ish lbs in the past 8 months. I have binge eating disorder. I went from 115 to 138 lbs and it is obvious on my 5'1 frame. I'm so embarrassed I can't look people in the eyes anymore. Not being able to keep my head up from the shame resulted in me losing my competitive job for not being able to perform anymore. I couldn't do projects or come up with ideas and I certainly couldn't pitch. I lost my soul, and now my dream. So I work a 9-5 I hate and every day I keep binging because I have hypoglycemia that my endocrinologist refuses to treat. So if I don't eat sugar constantly I'll have a seizure but I can't take the meds cause I don't have it ""bad enough"" for thyroid meds cause I'm only 22 and they don't give meds to people that young.

"It's really the only reason I'm actually living currently.I live an absolutely hopeless life.  I'm young, yes, only 17.  I haven't really been through any physical shit, though, just really mental.It all felt really mellow, calm, and weak.  Those are the words I can think of to describe it right now.  Years have blended together, and I don't remember many parts of my life, even though it's so short.I don't remember anything in detail before February 27th.  A few days after my birthday.  If you ask me to remember my birthday, I just remember the cake my brother got the image on it for.  It was some ironic meme I really liked and I couldn't stop laughing, and I think that was the best laugh I had ever had in my life.  Then my dad left us ""for good"", only to return 3 months later, without warning.I don't share things with friends.  I've never really had a real friend.  The closest I've had to this day is someone who's arguably more mentally fucked up than I am.  I haven't gone to the beach with some friends, or had a campfire with toasted marshmallows.  The closest thing I've had to that is going on a small camping trip where, while we did do those things, there was infighting before the trip, so it wasn't easy talking and whatnot.  As usual, I played as the guy who would start conversations, act like the idiot I've always been to cheer people up, make jokes, play along, you get the idea.I've only really been useful as a tool.  My life, beginning from when I got an injury, has been this way.  A condition fucked up my leg (It's considered a ""disease"" but it really isn't, it's just an internal physical fuck up) and I couldn't continue my martial arts.  I was 3 belts away from a black belt, and the injury worsened dramatically on the day of my graduation to the next one, to the point where I had to cancel my part on the very day.  I felt so ashamed, even though it wasn't anything I could control.From then on, the doctors told me I couldn't do physical activity.  I was skinnier than a string bean so I saw this as a positive thing at first, but no man, no.  It ruined my life.  The worst part of it was that it was so insignificant; nobody could really realize it was there.  I could feel the disappointment seeping through my P.E teachers' eyes.  I would just sit out every damn time because I had no fucking choice.Ever since then.  I became a tool.  I couldn't walk home, I couldn't walk with my friends home.  I couldn't walk to McDonalds at lunch time, I couldn't walk to my school.  I spent time alone.  So, so much time alone.  I read shitty books, I started playing video games more, I was so close to becoming a shut in, but then this girl came into our school when I was in Grade 7.  (G6 was when I was injured)Lots of details cut, I got a crush on her.  Skip to Grade 10, after lots happened in between, she one day comes to our normal classmate lunch spot on the verge of crying.  I, self-proclaimed genius, end up saying the EXACT wrong words; not exaggeration or anything, either, I basically explained the problem, said why it's bad, then said ""but it's fine!!!"", to sum it up.  Shunned by the mass over there, and so, so fucking rightfully so, I walk back to the corner, with the thought ""holy shit, did I deserve that!"", the feeling of a despicable human being, eating my lunch, and get this; she comes over to me and gives me pity.Yep, about right at that point, I realized something.  Two things, actually.  I don't deserve this.Why?Why did she have to do it?  I don't know.  I'll never know.  I could ask, but I won't get a right answer, let's be honest.I have ties, now.  I think now that if that had never happened, my exit from this shitty existence would just be a detriment to my parents and brother, but no.  Now I've got someone else I owe it to.I'm just a tool.  I didn't explain earlier, but when my parents were in constant quarrels, I was the tiebreaker.  My brother is the literal definition of an asshole and an airhead, my dad is an idiot to such an extent that he ends up just being an ass, and my mom is the definition of pity.My brother, two years younger than me, smokes weed frequently, does really fucking stupid shit ever since he started, acts like an asshole, and forces me to listen to rap, convinced that I am supposed to like it.  Spoilers: I despise rap, but nothing goes through his head.  This mess of a human is the direct result of my parents being too late.  My dad leaving was the ignition to his engine of wrongdoings.My mom being the definition of pity, is a fucking airhead.  After all the time; from 2015 to early 2017, that I spent trying to help her with my dad, she takes it all for granted, focuses on herself once he left, and completely forgets that she has another son; my brother.My dad, Sir. Fuckington the Idiot, III, leaves for 3 months, only a few days after my birthday, and when he comes back, completely without warning, he acts as if he never left, and as if he's a better person.  I was introduced to another mask.  It looks just like the ones all the people in my school wear, except it's much lighter, since you can actually see the absolute asshat peeking through time to time.  The eyeholes are too big, in my opinion.I helped my mom with her emotional struggle with my dad, I helped my dad become a better person, which he always tries to act like he is one, except he's a pretty big idiot, so there's that, and then there's my brother.  I can't do anything about him, so I urge my parents to take some sort of fucking action, but they're both FUCKERS who don't have any brains as far as I'm fucking aware.And, of course, there's her.  This girl who just drops into my life like I owe her something, makes me love her, and then, she's leaving after Grade 12.  All the while, she's harboring more pain than I could imagine of.[tl;dr?]Man, how the fuck am I supposed to live with this?  This is bullshit.  I'm good at this, but I never get a fucking chance to show it to anyone but family.  They barely deserve it, they just took it for granted, and now they too wear masks.  I'm sick of this, and I want to just fucking scream.  Maybe this is all I should've said.  Everyone around me is hiding.  I've gone so far to just hide my depression to bring out people's true emotions, but they hide.  I talk to them with my mental state in mind, and they just brush it off.  ""I'm fine"".  You're becoming adults, for fucks sake, TALK like adults.No, everyone hides everything.  I'm living in a world where everyone's playing hide and seek, except when I find them, they just say ""No, but I'm actually invisible!"" as if we were 6, making up bullshit about how we're invincible, invisible, angels and demons, gods and demigods.I fucking hate it.  What am I supposed to do?  I've wanted to kill myself for a couple years now but I keep holding on for these people.  Some guy last year decided to kill himself because his girlfriend broke up with him after he cheated on her.  I know the girl a bit, she was a very kind girl a few years back but after her family problems, she became just another mask.  After the incident, she disappeared.  She still goes to my school, but her emotions, her feelings, they don't even feel like they exist.It's gross.  It's so god damn disgusting.  I want to go to my school and yell at everyone from the top of my lungs to stop living this sick lie.  But it's far too late.  Everything's too late.I don't want to live in this world anymore, where nothing moves, and nothing has colour.  Where emotions are meaningless unless it's this sickeningly fake happiness everyone pretends to have.  Where friends are numbers, and love is a funny joke.God, I just want to die.  I so, so badly just want to fucking end it all.I'm really sorry this is so long.  It's just that I've written this too many times and I don't know how to make it smaller, so if anyone really reads all of this, leave some type of comment.  Some sign of life.  Thank you.",1

"I recently got into a new hobby that I'm very interested in and I've been able to hang out with close friends. Every time we get to, I have a lot of fun. My boyfriend and I go to different universities so we don't get to see each other often, but he's been starting to visit once a week if I'm lucky. All these things contribute to my happiness, but it's been small, temporary spurts of it. Other days I'll have thoughts of self-harm or jumping in front of a car, things like ""no one will notice me gone"" or ""if I disappear, it may be easier on my family since it's one less mouth to feed, one less tuition to pay for"" or ""if I disappear it won't make a difference in anyone's life"" I just have a constant voice in the back of my head that tells me I don't do good enough, I'm a nuisance to others, and I should kill myself.Ironically I'm very afraid of death so I go to self harm instead; it's like a chicken's way out. I try not to do anything rough enough that it will leave marks, but sometimes bruises or small scars are left.  I just want someone very close who I can confide in and talk about these thoughts, just to let it all out inside of bottling it up inside..

"I have another account that I often browse with but it's connected to my emails and usernames I use on other sites, so I made this. If this ends up too long I'll add a TL;TR at the end. Recently finished a degree. Got a basic job so I can save for a flat before applying for a Masters degree in 2018. I've suffered from major anxiety issues for about 7 years, mainly because I was always quite outgoing and confident, then my teeth became overcrowded, sucking the life out of my confidence. But anyway, the current issue is that just as I was getting on my feet financially and being able to dream about finally starting my life properly and paying to get my teeth fixed, my mother has pulled me into an inescapable mire. She's racked up ���, and counting, in rent arrears, not to mention she can't afford to pay her incoming rent (due to issues that aren't really relevant here). This has left me in a position where all my monthly wage goes towards keeping her from being homeless, which has taken away my first real chance to make a real life for myself. There is absolutely no way out of this situation. I've spoken to relevant departments and benefits experts, but ultimately all roads lead to my life being ruined for as long as she lives. She raised me, I know, and I don't hold a grudge against her. But I'm older than I'd like to admit and it has taken me so long to get to where I am, with what seemed to be real opportunities ahead of me. Now my life exists to work an uninspiring job, with zero confidence and anxiety issues that are off the charts. If I lived in the US I'd buy a gun and end it. Too scared to do the pills/whisky thing, too scared to do anything else really. And as much as people will say things will get better, they can't. I'm completely trapped in this situation, a situation I can't handle for much longer.TL;TR: After a long, long time I finally got my life on the right path, had a plan to tackle my anxiety and a clear plan to move on with my life. Suddenly my mother tells me she owes ��� in rent arrears and will be made homeless if I don't pay her rent and set up a payment plan for the arrears. It's taken me longer than I'd care to admit, even online, to get to a stage in my life where I could finally move forward but the moment it appeared it's been taken from me. Suicide appears to be my only option because as selfish as it sounds, I need to progress with my life and after all this time, energy and work, I can't do that. It's over for me. Appreciation to anybody who even scanned this post. And to the Mods, if this is in the wrong place, I apologise. ",1
"I know it's going to be the way I go out. In my life I keep coming back to my depression. I have periods in my life where I'm happy. But I always come back to this. It's exhausting. And I just want to end it, but I hate that my family will be pained by it. I hate living here. I hate existing.I went to church today. I haven't gone in like 4 years. I used to be really devout. But then I fell away. Today after service they were having a time for people to come up and be prayed for. So when mostly everyone was gone, I went up there and talked to a man. He was very kind. And I just started breaking down as I said the words ""I'm just going through a really hard time right now."" And he was understanding that it was hard for me to say much more than that. And he prayed with me. It felt really relieving for awhile. Idk if God is real or not. So idk if it was Him making me feel comforted or if it was just another person caring for me in that moment as I was vulnerable.I'm just so desperate for something to make me happy again. I'm so desperate for just security again. And I hate that I'm always going to live my life doing this roller coaster. Likely after my father passes away, I'll do it. I couldn't do it to him. He's got some time left so I'm not doing it any time soon. But I'm just in so much pain right now, it's hard to function. I think if I ever did, a lot of people would be shocked.

"There are two bridges my mind are focused on right now in my hometown, both of which I'm thinking of jumping off.One of them will make me plunge into a river. The other goes into train tracks.My name is Koda. This is not my first suicide note online. I don't think it'll be my last, but I hope it will. I'm 16. I'm studying Media at college. I really want to be a film editor. Something about working my way around Adobe Premiere, seeing what movements and transitions and shots work really makes me happily satisfied.I'm also really lonely, especially since I began college a few weeks ago. Any friends I used to have have found new ones and I've been left alone. My former best friend is gone too. I don't care. I'm almost glad. All he cares about his sex and drugs. Last time I spoke to him, it was asking if he could lend some pot because my uncle was dying and I was getting worked up about it. He said he didn't have any. He's a liar. I've seen his Snapchat and Instagram. Coke has taken my friend away from me, and until he sorts his shit out I don't want associate with him.My uncle died by the way. He didn't even check up on that. No sympathy. Maybe I'll fuck him over and rat him out to his parents, because they're sweethearts and deserve a better son.And then there's this girl who I've been infatuated with for a couple years now. We've kissed but never made anything serious out of it. It makes me sad and wonder if there's something wrong with me. Oh well. She's been there for me a lot. I owe her that.I don't know where I'm going with this. I just wish I could stop existing.If this had to be how a proper suicide note goes, then I guess I'll thank my sister for being better than anyone in this stupid fucking house. And my adorable little hamster Pippin - you rock, Pips.That's all. I'm thinking of killing myself in the sixteenth of October. On the 15th I'm in London seeing a show. I wouldn't miss that for the world.Have a better life, everyone.",1

"I'm at the point in my life now where I genuinely don't know if I want to live anymore. It's 50/50. Half of me wants to live and half of me wants non-existence. I feel like suicide would be the ultimate freedom.I first started really considering suicide when my OCD got to the point where I would do retarded repedetive shit and have non-stop tormenting OCD thoughts all day, every single day. I have for the most part overcome my OCD now, but the thoughts of suicide remain.I am a 19 year old high school dropout, unemployed, porn and cigarette addict, virgin, never had a girlfriend and pretty socially isolated nowadays. I don't feel connected to anyone. I don't feel any love for anyone. Not even my own immediate family. I don't feel close to anyone. I am pretty numb and dead inside.I see a lot of people say they wish they could kill themselves, but couldn't do that to the people around them. I don't feel that way at all. It may make me a selfish piece of shit, but I honestly could give a fuck how my suicide affects anyone. It's my life and I will be dead, so I literally won't be able to give a fuck.I have tried countless times to turn my life around in past, but inevitably ALWAYS end up failing.I'm still on the fense about whether or not I want to kill myself. So my plan is to give myself until June 1st, 2018 (a week before I turn 20) to try my best to show myself that my life is worth living. If I can't do that and am still in this same position by then, then it is time to end this once and for all.I can't take this same old cycle of the same old bullshit any longer then 8 months. It must end one way or another. It will end either through self-improvement or suicide.",1
So 4 weeks ago on Wednesday my best freind killed herself we met at the clinic after I'd attempted suicide that was 2 and a half years ago.At first I was angry at myself then at her and now life just seems pointless.My therapist said I should reach it to people and get help so here I am.Since she died I've attempted suicide twice and I've constantly thought about death.,1
"So I have social anxiety. As far as dating, it wouldn't be that big of a deal, as I can just use dating apps. However, I am too ugly for dating apps. So the majority of people tell me to just find dates IRL. But I have too much social anxiety for that shit to do IRL. So it goes right back to dating apps which I am too ugly for. Today a cute girl in my friend circle invited me to a party that takes place tonight. I usually can do good in social situations if I drink. However, I have to be up for work in the AM and I can't afford to go in late anymore. I am 28. I am an old fart and it is too late. I wish I could get my youth back, but I can't.

I also feel depressed again, I'm studying at university but I doubt myself a lot. How can I find jobs with social anxiety? I still struggle when I talk with others. I feel lost, I think about suicide, I'm afraid I'll kill myself if I don't find my path, my purpose. I wanted a job where I could help people, I did 3 years at university for this and I really wanted to and still want to help! But how can I help if I'm struggling? I feel like a burden...I'm wasting my parents money. If I kill myself they don't have to waste money for me anymore.

I need the money for rent however and to pay other bills. I also don't want to hurt my wife since my death would devisate her. I don't really know what to do because everything in my life is dependent on me having a job but my life is at risk from the job. Even if I could fight the anxiety long enough to get a new job it wouldn't help, i would  hate that job because of anxiety too. I really don't know what to do and med and doctors have been no help. I really don't think a doctor or medicine changes would help me fast enough at this point. I need advice. Anything.",1
"So basically I have decided that I am over being alive. I have been suicide since I was 12 maybe 13yrs old. I had a shitty past couple weeks and I do not feel like doing this any more. I have not fully decided the method but have narrowed it down to two different ways. One is bullet to the head. The other is OD on heroin. My question is this, how do I say good bye to the only friend I have? I don't know if it matters but I am a male and my friend is a female. I've known her for about 8 years now. Really the only reason I have made it this far is because of her. We have never done anything together as far as sex goes. We have never kissed. I normally see her a few times a week and spend the night at her house most the time when we hang out. I sleep in her bed next to her when I spend the night. She has begun to be part of the problem though. It's not her, it's me. Any way she knows what is going on and we are suppose to hang out tonight. Obviously she wants to try and talk me out of it and keep me from doing it. I on the other hand want to do it and will do it. It is only a matter of time now. I just want to tell her good bye but I am not sure how exactly I should do this. I could just hang out and say good bye but I feel she deserves something a little more unique. So how should I do this? Any suggestions? She is the only friend I have had that has never fucked me over or used me until I had nothing left to give. Her and I have been through hell together. Any way let me know what you guys think I should do. Thank you. ",1

"After my 8th time finishing Ender's Game, I think I finally understand it. I've come up with many explanations as to what the ultimate point of the book is over the years. This or that - you know - various forms of intelligence, creativity, government, morality, agression, resiliency, politics, personality traits, etc...  But the answer, I think, is this:  Ender's game is a argument against anarchy, and exploration of the various forms of leadership.  Every bit of the book shows every major success coming not from an individual successes but instead from well-organized and well-led groups working together under a single name. This is true not just for the humans, but the buggers as well.  This is why we see the exploration of bully groups, social groups, military structures, politics, etc. They're all organizations of one form or another.  The conclusion the book gives is then this: compassionate yet emotionally detached, strong leadership is the most effective way to run an organization of any kind. ",0

"Reading has lead me to the best thing in my entire life.                                  A few months ago, I took a look at this sub. I eventually came to a  by . I was not an avid reader, but I saw a few titles that I recognized, Hitchhiker's guide, Ender's game, Harry Potter among others. I was curious, so I went through on amazon and picked a few of the books out that looked interesting. I was so impressed by the stories. Some of them would stay with me for days, following around my every thought and idea. Some of them were less so, I later learned that one does not simply go into a book like slaughterhouse 5 without some context going forward. After the few weeks I spent reading some of the books on that list, Something strange started to happen to me. I would have dreams about the books, at first it was just my mind  making trippy abstract versions of the stories, Like the basilisk scene from the 2nd Harry Potter book. As the weeks went on, I continued reading, I would start to dream of different characters in different stories. The most intense and memorable one was seeing ender in the climactic ending of Lord of the Flies. The moment that changed me happened not to soon after this. I imagined a story, nothing amazing. It wasn't an amalgam of other stories, but of characters I had never read about. The day that happened I went to Google to try and find what story it was. But all my searches would lead me to things I was sure I had never read. This on top of the fact that My description was never close enough to the books description to make me suspicious. I wondered what was causing this, I sat down in my chair. I just kind of looked at a blank screen on my computer. I had this idea, If i tried to write it down, I would either remember what story it was reminding me of, or at least it would get it out of my head. So I tried, I opened Libreoffice and started hammering away at it. Words changed to sentences, Sentences changed to paragraphs. Those paragraphs became vignettes, those became chapters, I just fired words from my mind to the screen, thousands of words a day.  Not everything was amazing, I would sometimes not like an idea half way through and just open a new document. But I just couldn't stop.I had taken a few days away from my home to go on a vacation with my parents on the Oregon coast. I honestly itched to get back to my computer and continue, its not that i wasn't enjoying myself. But I just wanted to go back and continue with my characters, they really did feel like they were mine. They had lives and feelings, hopes, and flaws. I felt like I created something amazing.What I guess I am trying to say is that my momentary curiosity in books I was recommended here lead me to probably the best thing I have ever experience in my life. I loved to write, to create something bigger than I was and to tell its story. It was an addictive feeling, I honestly feel like if I had this feeling about anything else in the world I would have to check myself in, because there is no way you could be normal if you obsessed this much about something.But I am happy, I am honestly happy in a way I had never felt in my entire life. I have you fine people to thank for hosting this subreddit. If it were not for you, Then I would be sitting in my couch playing video games or watching the entire Netflix catalog. I bring all this up because after many months of feverish writing. I started writing a book. I won't say its name or anything about it to not break the sub rules. But I am honestly proud of myself for doing it. I have to thank all of you for it. You helped me find something I truly love doing.Thank you. From the bottom of my heart.",0
"What are your thoughts on Jonathan Lethem? I've just finished reading The Ecstasy of Influence, his collection of essays and reviews. Although a tad too self-reflexive at times, it really showcases a more scholarly side; both insightful and brilliantly written.  As for fiction,I've read and (mostly) enjoyed Motherless Brooklyn, Chronic City and The Fortress of Solitude. Not a fan of Men and Cartoons, however. Does anyone have any opinions on Lethem's work that they'd like to share?  ",0

I swing very far to the long epics, at first I found them intimidating but now they appeal to me more.

"Just Finished: Tad Williams series Memory, Sorrow and Thorn  So I just finished this series and was wondering what others thought of it and Tad Williams other books.I picked it up without knowing anything about it just grabbed it at a used book store.

Even going into book two, Stone of Farewell stats off very fast pace and continues until the end.

It's still on, and I'd love some suggestions for movies to watch once again This time, however, I'm looking for action movies, not Westerns.

So, I'd love some suggestions for must-see action films. That said, I do have some guidelines for this one that might help narrow things down. Nothing that fits within science fiction, Western, or fantasy, please. Got my own months for those. That includes superhero films, by the way (which I love, but I've seen most of them anyway).Action-adventure is fine, as are most other sub-genres of action.I recognize that the earliest action film is probably , but I'm putting that one under Westerns.

"Best books about cats ever: The Warrior Cat Series by Erin Hunter Discussion [Spoilers] These books got me into reading. I was inspired by another post and I thought we could all chat about the series as we remember them. I never finished, I think I stopped after the third or fourth installment of six books. It was a combination of growing out of them and finding books I liked better.  Who were your favorite characters? Which storyline do you remember that you liked best? Would you reread them?  I remember back then I didn't know what a prologue was, I figured it was an advertisement for the next book so I never read them.  I used to make my own websites and clans and fanfictions (unashamed rn). The way some people are with Harry Potter, I was with Warrior Cats. I was dedicated to that series man. Ate them up. I maybe stopped reading when I was 12 or so?  My favorite characters were Bluestar, Firestar, Tigerclaw and I think I liked Brightheart a lot as well as Brambleclaw.

"Magical Realism as a Genre and Black Sun Rising  They landed on a world with strangely swirling mists. Disembarking and beginning to build, the new colony slowly fell in love with their new home. Until the mists began to take form.At first it was wonderful, odd and exciting things wandered out of the mists- anything you could imagine, but as the population slowly grew fearful, it devolved into madness. Even more than their dreams and hopes, their fears were so strong that they fueled the nightmares which became reality and in turn fed the horror of the magic that was native to this new place.Technology began to fail, if you believed it would. Engines were openly examined, so that everyone would be reassured that they worked, people lost the non-tangible tech they had brought with them as it randomly became obsolete. Civilization devolved and their escape route closed before they realized it- the ships that brought them here no longer worked. He was a hero, fighting with everything he had to tame the mists, sacrificing anything for a better world- until the Church condemned him, and everyone believed it. Now he's no longer even a man, he feeds off of people and knows that on the other side awaits the lowest, burning hell. And a priest is going to ask him for help. Because believe it or not, inside the mists, things are getting worse...So with Quantum Psychology as an emerging field- how do beliefs affect the world of magical realism (which started with the inklings?)Anne Jindra

I like creature features, and I wanted to start light before diving into a massive 1000 page+ project like It or...anything else he's written.  Lol.  I read Cycle of the Werewolf.  Short novella, about 160 pages I think but it only took me about two hours to read.  Honestly I thought it was pretty great.  Werewolves aren't particularly to me (since I'm not like, 9) but the story was interesting and kept me engaged.  I particularly liked the way the narrator said that the werewolf would kind of be ""hiding in plain site"" in human form because it was a small town and everyone kinda knew each other.  My only wish is that it provided some clues for the reader to try to figure out who it is before the reveal.  Anyone else read this one?  What did you think?",0

"When you finish a book, can you say for sure that you understood everything, grasped every concept and would be able to recap the whole book at any time?  I just finished a non-fiction book* that was, for me, a challenging read. 
In retrospective, I'm not sure I grasped all the concepts of the book and that I'm 100% sure about all the points made in the book. Even though I found it very interesting, I struggled mostly with paying attention for an extended period of time. 
Or is it, like in my case, a vague idea that you've created and lots of new info that you don't have on hand but given the right circumstance would come up in your mind. I'd like to minimize this with each and every book I read, also being able to critically read the suggested concepts. I'd like to be able to argue with the writer or consciously agree with them, not just passively accept what is being given to me. 
I'm not sure if this is normal, but nevertheless I would like to push myself and be a better, more analytical and focused reader.*The Sixth Extinction",0

""It,"" as a property, is something to which I could devote two hours, but I'm less interested in sacrificing something in my current book queue for King's novel. There's just so much more I'd rather read right now and well into the future, too. However, as far as scratching the itch for an autumnal dose of horror? The movie would suffice.This makes me feel vaguely guilty, though. I don't encourage spurning literature in favour of a film -- as a shortcut or a disregarding of the product of one medium over that of another -- and that's not what I'm trying to do. In this case, it's just a matter of interest level and time. I'm interested enough to see the film, but not to read the book. Is my guilt over this warranted? I don't know. Maybe I should just hold off on the movie until I whittle my queue down and can read King's book.",0
"Just finished Dark Places by Gillian Flynn... my God.  I’ve now finished all 3.5 of Flynn’s novels and I gotta say, she is the masterclass of women’s transgressive fiction. I couldn’t quite put my finger on what it was that made her stories so unique and beyond just great, compelling storytelling and mysteries, her characters, both protagonist and antagonists (in muddled air quotes for both) are so flawed and simultaneously detectable and relatable. These people would all be hate-able in real life but I can’t help but relate to so many of their darker aspects. I think what adds to this is what Flynn herself has said about her works. She’d read so much about dark male characters and the inherent darkness in us all but very few that tackled this for women. I’ll admit I don’t think I’ve read much of any female-driven stories before Flynn that did this for women. As a man, it really opened my eyes to a level of complexity that I really had never seen touched for women. Possibly because of so many social norms and expectations of women being less... dark? Less prone to deep inner complexity that skews toward what’s . If that’s offensive, I apologize. Flynn has changed my perception on all of this. In three books she’s showed us the darker side of three roles women find themselves in: aristocratic, stifling motherhood, neglected, transgressive girlfriend, and unappreciated, expected wife. I think she gives Palahniuk a run for his money in the transgressive area if only because of how much more realistic her portrayals seem. ",0

Do you chase a theme through history; ""The Evolution of the Hero's Journey Through the 20th and 21st Centuries?""

"When Strangers Meet I just started   by Kio Stark, and I hate it. Maybe it gets better later; but it seems...well, just not well thought out. Below I will list my reasoning; note that I have only just started, and this is not my final conclusion; but I just want to point out the problems so far, because I feel like I need to vent to someone other than the professor who assigned it as reading.   People always want to classify other people. However, those that say people always want to do anything are usually false and using that as an excuse to get their way.     However,   and using that as an excuse to get their way.   Mrs. Stark contradicts herself. She states that humans always want to classify, but then goes back on this, saying that anyone that says humans are hardwired to do anything are usually false, and that humans are not hardwired in any way, including hardwired to classify. I suppose she could be making the argument that it is not a genetic compulsion; but this is very unclear in her wording.   She only looks at classification of other people, and ignores all other classifying that humans-and indeed just about all animals-take part in. Classification is as vital to humans as food or water; we classify bears as a threat, this berry as good to eat and this one as poison, this area as safe and this area as unsafe. Classification is vital to our survival; without it we would end up eating leaves and drinking bleach without a second thought, and then probably never learning from our mistakes.   Kio Stark seems to be thinking that these scientists are only using these studies as self serving justification of racism and stereotyping, which couldn't be farther from the truth. These scientists are noticing a problem, which is that humans stereotype other humans. Then they are asking themselves why they stereotype in this way, and why it is so universal across all people. Study of animals, speculation and just plain logical deduction hold the answer. Humans would live in groups; we'll call them packs. After all, we are social creatures, like wolves. However Africa (where we originated, in places such as Egypt and Mesopotamia) did not hold many areas with plentiful food; so packs could only be so large, and if there were two packs in the same area, there wouldn't be enough food to go around. The same problem would arise if these two packs joined together. Therefore it was advantageous to fight off different packs; the origins of racism. Does this excuse racism and make it okay? Obviously not, and that isn't what the scientists who came up with these theories were thinking. They were just noticing a problem and giving a reason for said problem; if not a solution.   Her statement that humans are not hardwired to do anything is inherently false. As she says herself they are hardwired to classify; similarly, we are hardwired to eat, find shelter, and try to find human connection. We want to seek out and eat food because it helps us survive; and, believe it or not, the fact that we want food is NOT justification for overeating. Hard to believe, I know. There are so many things we are hardwired to do; classification being among them. No, it does not mean that we do it all the time with everything, as Kio seems to believe; but it is definitely true.  Another Problem, with another section of the book, is that she mentions that talking to strangers is always good; you will enjoy it, and it will make you happy. The only evidence she has mentioned to go along with this are a series of studies that are completely unsourced, so we have no idea who performed then, and they are also very low quality.   There were three groups; though it is unclear if the same subjects were used in each group or different ones were, or how many subjects were involved. Group A was in a Starbucks, Group B was in a subway, and Group C was in a waiting room. Group A was told to talk with the barista as if they were a close friend, or not. Group B was said to do the same, but with the other people on the subway. Group C was given similar instructions but with the other people in the waiting room. After leaving, those that had chosen to talk to others proved to be happier than those that had chosen to not talk.     The ""Or Not."" The people who chose to talk were most likely comfortable talking to strangers; meaning that it only makes sense that they were happier after talking to other people even if they didn't know them. The ones who refrained were most likely not comfortable with talking to strangers, meaning that the awkward social situation would, in and of itself, cause them to not feel comfortable; meaning that of course they would register feeling less happy when they left. Therefore the conclusion of this study is horribly skewed; it is set up so that the only conclusion is ""People like talking to strangers.""   As I mentioned, this study was unsourced and the specifics were not mentioned. Who performed the study? Where was it done? Who were the test subjects? Were they from the US, Brazil, the UK, France, China, Russia? Everything is left very unclear and unspecific, leading me to believe that A) the study did not take place, or B) if we did know the specifics of the study we would immediately be able to debunk it's conclusions.  Obviously I need to keep reading to make any final conclusions; but this seems like a fairly bad start to the book.  ",0
"What are your reading habits like?  I try to read about 10% of a book daily, which is usually pretty manageable (this amounts to 25 - 35 pages a day on your average book).

There are some exceptions though (for example, I blazed through All the Light We Cannot See and Murder on the Orient Express in two days each)On Saturday I came up with a slightly different strategy. I got a few books from the library and decided to take the page count, divide by 14 (since I keep the books for two weeks), and then make that my daily read goal.

Are there any strategies that I can use to read these types of novels? I'd love to be able to read some Dostoevsky eventually without feeling like I have no idea what is going on.",0
"Favorite assigned reading from school?  So I read a thread about least favorite books that people had to read for school, and I  was wondering if anyone had favorites that they had to read for school that they might not have read otherwise. Mine is probably Hamlet, because even though I still don't think it's the best thing ever or anything, the ""to be or not to be speech"" was the first time I understood what people meant when they talked about Shakespeare's language.",0
"Are you ever afraid of reading a book too many times? A year ago I read a book that I absolutely loved with all my heart. Not going too much into it, but now I'm reading it for the fourth time. I'm still enjoying it as much as the first time, but I fear that one day, when I pick it up, it'll be just ""meh"".  It's very hard for me to find a book I like, much less one I love, so one day the idea to get bored of it makes me hesitant/scared to re-read it. Has it actually happened to you to get bored of a book that you previously loved? Or do you know how to prevent that? Just wondering if someone's ever felt the same way :P ",0
"What qualifies as a ""book""/""novel""  I saw a lot of posts around new years of people hitting their goals and making new goals for the year for the number of books/novels read. I'm just curious and want to know what you lovely bibliophiles consider a book/novel. Is it by number of pages? Age/comprehension level? Etcetera?Edit: thank you all for the awesome replies! I guess it doesn't matter what I read, as long as I enjoy the stories I find. I'm proud to say I have read 4 books so far this january. I'm going to stomp the amount I read in 2017",0
"So why did people hate Pixels so much?  I finally just saw this and, as a gamer, thought it was pretty good. The plot worked well enough and the video game representations were all pretty cool. It was pretty funny too. It seemed to be as good as pretty much any other Sandler movie.The only reason I can see for hating this movie is if you hate video games, or maybe are just indifferent to them.",0

"I don't like Aldous Huxley's writing style, what am I missing?  I just finished  and while I found the themes and ideas fascinating, I found the book disappointing from a literary point of view. So I logged onto reddit and found tons of posts discussing the merits of Huxley's vision so I won't bring that up again. But, one thing that came up in a lot of the threads was that people seem to love Huxley's writing style. I just don't get it, I've only read  and  but I found both unnecessarily difficult to read. Huxley seems to have a fondness for long and unneeded words like ""parenthetically"" and his constant references to other writers/notable individuals makes me feel like I'm missing out on something. Anyway, I have two questions: If you like Huxley's writing style, what is it that you like? What am I missing? If you don't like Huxley's writing style, why not? Is it for reasons similar to or different from mine? I really like learning and talking about writing styles so all opinions are welcome.  some nerd wants to know what you think about Aldous Huxley's writing style. ",0
"I just read ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt in 3 days. I don't think I've been as engrossed in a book since I was a child.  I had 2 exams and a paper due this week, so this book very nearly ruined my life. From the moment I picked it up, I couldn't stop reading, my GPA be damned. This is a feeling I haven't experienced since I was 9 years old, pulled into Harry Potter for the first time. I just finished the book today, and it was phenomenal. The characters were all dark and intriguing, and the book left me wondering who was truly bad, and who was good. The theme of college bonding and friendship was so perfectly captured that I almost felt nostalgia for something that I'm currently experiencing. It's been ages since I've considered tackling a book over 500 pages, but this one just seemed to fly by. I would recommend it to anyone. And as an aside, my tests went fine!",0
"Can metafiction be positive?  I adore stories of all kind.  Some of my favorite literature comes in the form of metafiction, which is supposed to be fiction that's aware it's fiction.  One of its most widely-used tropes is when characters break the fourth wall, like Bugs Bunny addressing the viewer as he outwits his latest adversary, and it's usually used for comedic effect.More recently, however, I've been finding examples of really excellent metafiction that acknowledges its own limitations and uses them.   by Tim O'Brien used its untrustworthy nature as fiction to deliver a harrowing war story.   by Mark Z. Danielewski subverts all conventions of the novel genre to deliver pure paranoia and fear to the reader.  Sheesh, I'd even call the brilliant ""Too Many Cooks"" commercial by Adult Swim a kind of metafiction.I understand that metafiction like this can never become the majority, and that if it did, it would cease to be metafiction.  And by nature, it'll toy with any reader who's just looking to escape from reality, which could contribute to its power.  But is it possible for metafiction to be powerfully done and also uplifting?  Is metafiction always brutal, leaving the reader white-knuckled and uncertain of their own reality?",0

With that said, it is a very tough read in that it truly illustrates human beings most grotesque abilities to judge one another.

"[Spoilers] Just finished 1984 by George Orwell. Feeling conflicted about the ending.  I literally just finished it. It is my first ""sad ending"" book that ive ever read, yes, first, I tend to read  more upbeat stuff, as well as biographies. ANYWAYS, the ending. I didnt feel any sweet relief, any glimpse of hope except at the very last line. ""I love big brother"". At first read, it seemed sad, bitter, and a little angry for such a sorrowful, dreary ending. BUT, after mulling it over. I feel a bit of happiness for Winston, because he finally is able to understand his life, and not have the constant questioning in his head. He finally got the clarity needed to understand what his life is going to be about. He does lose whatever hope he had once the telescreen tells of the africa front, but he appears to be able to cope with the reality, and swallow it down like his sachharide pill, or victory gin. He downs it, even though he knows it doesnt taste good, but it keeps him sane.  To me, Winston finally accepts his fate, and no longer wonders. A ""sweet release of death"" sort of feeling for him.

"Red Rising series?  Hi all! So I picked up Red Rising a few days ago bc I was in the mood for a gripping YA read to power through after reading a few heavier books. I just finished it tonight and I feel... totally underwhelmed. I’m not meaning to hate on Brown at all, I thought it was an interesting world and his pacing was fairly decent, but I found the writing pretty sub par, there were a few consistency issues, and I really didn’t engage with any of the characters in particular. In truth, I found Darrow pretty damn irritating most of the time. However, I’ve seen loads of people rave about this series - can anyone convince me that I should keep going with the next two books of the trilogy? Does it improve from here on out? I don’t want to give up on it but I’m also not super motivated to start the next one. I’d be interested to hear people’s general thoughts on this book and the series (but please no spoilers from books 2&3!).~~~Bonus points for sharing your other favourite YA books/series. :)",0
"I am Brianna Goux, a 19 year old redditor who has published her first young adult sci-fi novel, AMA!  Here’s a bit about me:
My name is Brianna GouxI have an unhealthy obsession with giraffes I’m graduating from the University of Iowa this MayI own a cat, a dog, a horse, and probably have a future animal hoarding problem.My proof: besides being the only Brianna Goux alive (and maybe ever), here is some proof that I am who I say I am., ,  and my  (not proof, I just think she's cute). Oh, and Hello! I’m the author of Amara’s Rose- a Young Adult Science Fiction/Fantasy novel with kickass female leads. I started writing this novel because when I went to middle school all of my friends when to different schools so Rose, Phoenix, Sylvia, and Derek became my friends. I wrote of their adventures and from that this book came forth. My motivation for carrying this novel through the long, arduous process of taking it from a shitty first draft, through editing, and to publishing is that I wanted to write the characters I wish I had read growing up. This book is groundbreaking for this genre in that four out of my five main characters are female, there are no predominant romantic plots or love triangles; there is only a mission Rose is on to save her people and the determination of my characters to save their world. I’ve been writing for as long as I can remember and have gone from writing short stories about a border collie named Millie to writing 400 page novels about Rose and her intergalactic adventures. The first novel, which was published a few days ago, I have been working on for five years. Ask me anything about life, writing, or giraffes- I’ve got answers for you.EDIT: EDIT 2: I've been at this for seven hours- I'm going to take a quick 30 minute breakEDIT 3: It's been 9 1/2 hours- I'll try and answer the remaining questions tomorrow. I'm going to try to get to everyone so don't fear if I haven't answered your questions yet!FINAL EDIT: I wanted to answer everyone's question, but unfortunately things are going south. I am not perfect, this is my first novel, and I have a lot to learn. I'm happy that many of you seem interested, and I'm happy that many of you gave me feedback. I'm always looking to learn and feel as though this situation has taught me a lot. Cheers! ",0

"Just finished reading Angie Thomas's ""The Hate U Give"" and it's most definitely the best book I've read this year It's a young adult   about a 16 year old black girl called Starr, who witnesses the fatal police shooting of her friend, Khalil. I began reading this book yesterday and consumed it within 24 hours. It's the most heartbreaking book I've read in a while and the issues it deals with are heavy but very important, especially in 2017: police brutality, racism, gang violence and cultural differences. At its heart, its core, it's about losing someone you love, and in a violent, senseless way.  The writing is clever, smooth and often hilarious. The characters are alive and breathing: you really feel like you know them after putting the book down. Props to Angie Thomas. I didn't think there'd be a book I read this year that could top ""Never Let Me Go"" but ""The Hate U Give"" just came out of nowhere and took the crown. I highly recommend.  ",0

"For those who thought they didn’t have time to read, what did you give up to make time for reading?  I used to think I didn’t have time to read between a full time job, online computer science classes, and iOS development the rest of my time. But, about a month ago I realized how much time I wasted on Reddit. I used to lie down in bed for 1-3 hours sometimes just on Reddit. This was like a nightly thing. Or I would waste 1 hour after coming home or Reddit my entire lunch breaks. I decided to buy a Kindle and decided to spend my time reading books rather than read Reddit. I believe I got the Kindle about 3 weeks ago. So far I’ve read 5 books in it. I try to read 2 books a week.

The narrator says in his opening sentence: ""Alexey... still remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place.""

"Are You A Fan Of Movie Novelizations?  I was never really into the idea of reading them since I thought it was just the film as a book. But I later heard that the novelization for the Assassin's Creed movie had several key things that weren't in the film or had been cut. So I read it a couple of weeks ago and it adds a good amount of stuff to the film (It answers why Cal killed the pimp, gives you more backstory for Aguilar and the Abstergo prisoners, fleshes out Cal and Sofia's relationship more, etc). I'm shocked all of this was removed from the film as it would've made it better.What's your favorite movie novelization and what's one that really adds to the film? Comment and let me know.

"I just read Jurassic Park and it was good.  I recently read a thread about how crappy of a movie Jurassic world was. There were many comments about how different the Jurassic Park book was to the original movie. The thread in reference was how little the characters learned from their mistakes and we're still shown as hero's. (Jurassic World)The book was a really engaging read, my first by Crichton, and had a really good pace. I wasn't disappointed by the length but was also surprised by how 'short' the book seemed. Really it played like game of thrones where many people that I grew attached to died, whom did not in the movie. (HBO still kills everyone)The difference of character interactions and portrayal from the movie was very Stark. Hammond seemed a stupid man and Malcom a character who is ignored and proved correct at every turn. The kids different, seemed they took the boy and split him into both characters in the movie. Dr. Grant was an unassuming hero who scraped by with his wits and luck. I could go on but the comparisons have been done before.Overall this was a solid read over a week of evening readings. The story was compelling and still held up to scientific light. The technology was still appropriate and held muster. So while not timeless it was not like watching a movie where a cell phone would have solved everything.I really enjoyed this book and would recommend.",0

"Zadie Smith on ""stepping away from the vehicle""  “When you finish your novel, if money is not a desperate priority, if you do not need to sell it at once or be published that very second — put it in a drawer. For as long as you can manage. A year or more is ideal — but even three months will do. Step away from the vehicle. The secret to editing your work is simple: you need to become its reader instead of its writer. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve sat backstage with a line of novelists at some festival, all of us with red pens in hand, frantically editing our published novels into fit form so that we might go onstage and read from them. It’s an unfortunate thing, but it turns out that the perfect state of mind to edit your own novel is two years after it’s published, ten minutes before you go onstage at a literary festival. At that moment every redundant phrase, each show-off, pointless metaphor, all the pieces of deadwood, stupidity, vanity and tedium are distressingly obvious to you. Two years earlier, when the proofs came, you looked at the same page and couldn’t see a comma out of place.[…]You need a certain head on your shoulders to edit a novel, and it’s not the head of a writer in the thick of it, nor the head of a professional editor who’s read it in twelve different versions. It’s the head of a smart stranger who picks it off a bookshelf and begins to read. You need to get the head of that smart stranger somehow. You need to forget you ever wrote that book.”",0
"Just finished **House** of Leaves for the first time. What an incredibly fun experience. (No spoilers in op but comments are fair game)  This book was amazing. Without spoiling anything, it's a very meta, layered novel that is designed so you're able to concurrently share in the obsessions that consume the novel's characters.It's a monster of a novel, but I finished it in three sittings. I have never experienced any novel that plays with the actual physical form of a book. I can't imagine  being as remotely as effective as an ebook, let alone a film or television show.I could totally see how some would hate  of Leaves, but me, I still feel high from that read two days later. No wonder it's been perceived as an instant classic.Anyone wanna talk about this happy, little novel?",0
"Just finished reading ""The Maze Runner"" (the first three books). Is it normal to have cared more about the story than the characters? (spoilers)  I started reading a few months ago, and this is the 2nd series that I have read (the other being Michael Grant's ""Gone"" series). While I definitely enjoyed The Maze Runner, I wanted to know how you all reacted to the books. Note: I've only read the first 3 books (The Maze Runner, Scorch Trials, Death Cure), not all 5 books.What I thought was interesting is that I cared more about the story than the characters. For example, when Aris and Teresa 'betray' Thomas in the 2nd book, my reaction was not, ""Aw, poor Thomas. I don't like Teresa/Aris now."" My reaction was, ""Wait, are they right for doing this? Are they telling the truth? I'm confused."" I wasn't attached to the characters too much. I read solely to answer the question ""What is going on and why?""I don't think this is a bad thing, I truly did enjoy the books and found most every story told in this world interesting. But I wish I cared about the characters more. However, to me, it felt like the story was bigger than the characters (Thomas). And I wish I cared more about Thomas. But it's hard to care about a character when their story is ""I'm in a maze now, how did I get here? Oops, did I do this? Sorry, let me not choose to not remember anything so the reader stays confused."" Now in hindsight I can see this as Thomas's redemption story: Thomas helped to create controversial human experiments, realized they are bad, and vowed to take it down. Maybe if I read with the intention of sympathizing with Thomas instead of reading with the intention of understanding WICKED I would have enjoyed the books more. But in reading this the first time I was so focused on ""wait, who is telling the truth"" that I didn't invest into the Thomas's growth as much. Is this normal?How did you all feel about The Maze Runner series? When reading, is it a normal thing to care about ""the story"" more than ""the characters""? Do writers make books for us to intentionally care more about the story? Any other feelings about this series you want to mention? Thanks for reading my wall of text!",0

"Reading classics with attention difficulties  I find it reasonably easy to read JK Rowling, Brandon Sanderson, Veronica Roth, Suzanne Collins etc. Obviously.. vocab is super simple, quite action/thought driven.. language is in vernacular I use every day. I do struggle every time a new setting or character comes into the mix, and during descriptions, but whatever. I've worked out a lot of strategies for dealing with attentional drain (I'm an aspie with ADHD)But give me a classic or an older sci fi/fantasy and I don't know what to do. It is so overwhelming. The weird names all confuse and bother me, perhaps due to pronunciation hangups, the millions of characters haphazardly introduced, the terminology, the history (if I don't know the history). I wish these books could be rewritten (without losing their rich content) in current vernacular.. I find it impossible to even get a few pages into them. Yet I really want to read them because they are so rich with experience from a time I do want to know about. I read very thoroughly because I hate not being thorough but become exhausted by the second page. I lose the larger story in the thicket of descriptions and considerations. It all goes straight through me even if I can picture each sentence. Has anyone got any tips for handling this? Perhaps selective reading (but then you have to know what's important and what isn't) or some other tips. I mean people still read those books so it must be comprehensible and consumable to some degree, and you don't have to be a genius to read them.. am I missing something?",0
"Thoughts on Reading Communities  My University has a beautiful library, but I am sad to see that it is mainly used for academic purposes. It does not feel like the right place to go when you want to get lost in a new book. I think it could benefit from a recommended reading list, a book club, or any other form of reading communities.

Silly prose; painfully contrived dialogue; general triteness; gaping plot holes; you name it. Maybe even a no-fault sea change in your subjective preferences. Anything goes. I ask because I just reread Roger Zelazny's ""Jack of Shadows."" I last read it when I was about eleven, and I remember it as being so heartwrenchingly lyrical and dark and edgy and profound...but Jessica H. Chrysler, IT. IS. AWFUL. It's...it's not even comically awful, it's grievously awful. (If you've read it, BTW, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Let me know and I'll start a thingie about it.) Bottom line: have you ever found yourself disappointed, mortified, or appalled by any of the books you loved when you were young? Why?  Edit: Another example--and you'd be totally justified in calling me a fragile-ass snowflake for this one--is Maurice Sendak's ""Outside Over There."" When I was really tiny, that book was just THE BEST...and as an adult, I find it inexplicably frightening and disturbing beyond all reason. (Actually, this is more ""cower"" than ""cringe""...it's an objectively great book. But on that note, please consider your weird reactions to be fair game, too.) ",0

"A Weird Problem I have While Reading  I've written this post in order to start a dialogue and see if anyone else out there has these same issues. So far, after talking to friends, family, and other people on Reddit, I have yet to find a single person to have these same reading issues. Let me explain.I am very picky about where to read. I can't stand the sound of any alien noises interrupting me or distracting me from literature, and so I often read at night where there are no distractions. But there is an issue: my mind seems to always distract itself with music. This might sound odd, so let me explain further.Practically everyone understands what it's like to get a song stuck in there head, so imagine trying to read, but no matter what, there is a song leaving you to be distracted from the text and hear that song. And it's not even just one song usually. It's like a playlist in my head, and it is so annoying. Sometimes I'll read just a few pages in blissful focus, but then, the songs start to enter. I sometimes have to stop and try to focus on just basic things that I'm reading, and the songs also cause me to miss certain information.I don't think this is the result of boredom with the content which I read because even the novels that I sincerely enjoy still cause me to receive the monotonous barrage of music. I don't think I have ADD or ADHD because I don't really have any other symptoms of those mental illnesses. I can focus on my school work fine, I can pay attention when someone's talking, and I am generally calm. I'm also not dyslexic. It's just the repetition of music that happens whenever I read that is the absolute worst for me, and I have no idea how to stop it. I've tried multiple things. I've tried to pause at moments in the story and imagine all the sounds that are occurring within the story, I've turned on classical music which really just serves as a further distraction from my reading, and I've tried to read aloud but I always stumble on words whenever I do so. I feel like it's entirely hopeless, and I really wouldn't be going on the internet and going before others who like literature if it was just a minor distraction. For me, it's like not having any glasses for the story. I can pick up generally shapes and colors, but lots of detail is critically impaired and lost.If anyone has ever had this issue before or is currently having it, please lend me your thoughts about it. Even if you haven't before, I'd love to hear any thoughts or further questions you might have.",0

"[Spoilers] I just finished The Road by Cormac McCarthy; these are my thoughts.  I had recently finished Blood Meridian, so I wasn't expecting a happy ending. Despite this, The Road, while it was an amazing book, left me with a feeling of vacuousness and emptiness I wasn't expecting. I thought at the end, since there were so many allusions to the fact that the sun was no where to be seen, maybe it would end with them trudging along, still fighting off cold and starvation, but get a glimpse of sunlight as a sign of hope. Nope. The book wasn't nearly as disturbing as Blood Meridian, however the cannibal basement and the skewered, headless infant on the campfire (though to be honest I expected this when they saw the pregnant woman, call me fucked up) were certainly stomach churning. McCarthy did an incredible job filling me with the sense of cold, nothingness, despair and utter desolation in the wake of an unknown disaster. I hoped before reading the book that the disaster would be stated, but when I got into it, I realized I didn't care about what started it, rather what would finish it. As I was reading it, I was physically cold. I had to wear several blankets, and a hoodie as I followed the characters in their quest simply for survival. That's how much the scenery and environment encapsulated me. I found myself questioning what I would do in their situations and was constantly switching sides between what the boy wanted and what his father saw as necessary. I will say I was so happy when they found the bunker full of food, water and fresh clean linens. It was like an X-Ray apron being lifted off of me, and I was happy that they got to enjoy that little bit of sanctuary. All in all, it was a fantastically bleak read, and I look forward to reading more of McCarthy's works. For now, however, I think I need to take a break from the ever enshrouding doom and nothingness that McCarthy weaves into his works. ",0
"Book readers & movie watchers: Could the original screenplay ever be an appealing source of fiction? (LA Times article - discussion)  Books inspire movies. Movies inspire books. But there's one source of fiction that remains unappreciated: the original screenplay.The L.A. Times recently published this article (linked above) about the death of the original screenplay. As the article mentions, films such as ""Goodwill Hunting"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" were developed from original screenplays. Stories like these are still being written, but Hollywood isn't interested. Nothing happens to 99% of the original screenplays written each year (less than a percent are moved into production.) They aren't read or enjoyed because they've failed to achieve the purpose they were created for, but that seems to me like an untapped reservoir of potentially wonderful stories!I'm wondering, have any readers here ever read and enjoyed a screenplay? They are written entirely in the present tense, use scene headings instead of describing location, and communicate story primarily through structure, dialogue and pacing (with symbolism and metaphor nonetheless abound.) Maybe Hemingway fans might find this format appealing? Does it intrigue anyone else?",0
"Children's books about incarcerated parents  I recently discovered a very small genre of children's books, and I'm so glad it exists. There are picture books specifically written about when a parent goes to jail or prison. For example , , or . I'm a parent of young children, so I'm always looking at new books to get my kids. I'm also a criminology student. So when I found books about imprisoned parents, I was excited and a little surprised. But it makes sense. In the United States alone, there must be millions of children who experience a parent going to jail/prison. I showed a few to one of my professors. She shared with me that her father spent years behind bars when she was growing up, and she said that books like this would have really helped her cope with the stress and stigma. I wish there were more of these books that could help children deal with this specific and stressful experience.I'm curious if any of you have read books like this when you were a child? Have you read anything like this to your children or children you know? What are your thoughts about these types of books? Are they actually helpful? Do you know of any more books like this?",0
"Tips on how to identify bad writing  One thing I have always struggled with was understanding what people mean when they say something is badly written. Sure, I can grasp on some of the basic aspects that cause a particular literary work to be considered poorly written: bland characters with conflicting motivations, dialogue that feels unnatural, plot holes, abundance of overused tropes, etc. However, I do have a hard time identifying these tropes, especially bad dialogue. Maybe it is because I am an introvert weirdo who has about as much social interaction as a crippled ww1 veteran with the spanish flu, but I can only distinguish writing when it is particulary awful (the ""how is your sex life?"" line from The Room) or when it stands out as something wonderful (the ""war backwards"" passage from Slaughterhouse). I would like to know if there was a way to sharpen my perseption of writing. Otherwise, I am afraid I will become a tone-deaf idiot who thinks Dan Brown novels and crappy fantasies for lonely people like Twilight are the pinnacle of storytelling.",0

"Reading Crime and Punishment. Just want to talk about it.  I'm to the part right before the murder, and I had to stop and take a break for a while. I'm taking a break here to think.

For a while I almost started to but the mental games he plays with himself saps that. His feckless, lazy, parasitic nature makes me ill.

Beating old horses to death is a fun hobby, nobody seems to even want to work, and just reading about this life makes me want to go make sure the doors are locked. This place and these people make me want to wash myself. This society has a sort of urban Mad Max feel to it and the car hasn't even been invented yet. Do these people just live to suffer? This makes Russians seem so brutal and hopeless and apathetic and consumed by self-defeat that it makes one wonder in awe how it's even possible they got a civilization off the ground. So far it's less descriptive than Angela's Ashes and there's been less death and failure but things still seem somehow bleaker and more hopeless and even worse. ",0

"Struggling with Jorge Luis Borges  Sorry in advance for how stupid I must appear 😂So... I'm not the most experienced reader. Having only exposed my brain to easy reading, I'm not used to the kind of complex literature that tends to require prolonged moments of rumination in order to digest the meaning/allegory of the story and the like. My cousin is an avid reader (scarily intelligent), and his passion for literature infected me so I asked if I could borrow some favourites of his, one of which was  by Jorge Luis Borges, which is a compendium of his stories and poems. After reading his stories however, I'm having a really difficult time understanding some of them. It's like...I can see and comprehend what's happening on the surface (some of the time), but the deeper meaning often seems out of my reach. And some other times the stories are just so cryptic to me that I have a hard time following them at all. I really enjoyed the story . On the surface it's about an Encyclopedia written by a series of intellectuals, the contents of which describe a planet and people who exist hypothetically but whose philosophies are so enticing that they become adopted by us (from what I remember, I read the story around 3 months ago so forgive me if the details are a little off). But again, I always feel like there's some deeper meaning I'm not seeing. Is there a way for me to get better at reading into the subtext or deciphering the text more effectively/accurately?In general, I really enjoy the way he writes. The aesthetic qualities of his prose really appeal to me. But I'm not sure I'm ready for this kind of complexity. What am I missing here?",0

Some of the ebooks, don't have this available. I tried reading ""Consider Phlebas"" and got about half way through, but then found myself zoning out and losing concentration again.

"I really like the way Ann Leckie handles aliens  So I'm nearly done with , Ann Leckie's new book, and what's really striking me is the unique way she approaches aliens and humans and how they interact. This is explored somewhat in the Ancillary trilogy with the Presgar and their ""translators"" but  delves into it even more with the Geck. I feel like so many sci-fi authors either write their aliens as completely inscrutable beings we'll never be able to communicate with or as basically humans - maybe they have different bodies and different cultures, but they assimilate with us fairly easily in spite of this (the Star Trek approach.) In the Imperial Radch universe, interacting with aliens is a dangerous and unpredictable business. There is a treaty that governs how members of different species interact with one another, and since one of the alien races that signed the treaty doesn't distinguish between different human governments if any human breaks the treaty all humans will have been considered to have broken the treaty. There is very little common ground between the different races and very little in the way of cultural exchange. We are just fundamentally too different to really get along. But, at the same time, they have become a part of every day life that people accept. There's some excitement if an alien ship docks in your little port, but no more so than if the mayor were to walk into the restaurant where you work. It's a story you'll tell that night at dinner, but it's not life-altering. If you're a bureaucrat or a government employee, an alien getting involved with things mostly just means a lot of annoying paperwork.It seems to me that if we ever were to meet aliens, they would fall somewhere between these two extremes, that we'd find a way to coexist but never really assimilate. I can't think of any other works that manage to thread that needle in a way that feels believable, and honestly I'm just really impressed by it.Do other people who have read the books agree? What other works handle aliens in a similar way?",0

"I just finished ""Never Let Me Go,"" and it tore me apart.  Today I finished ""Never Let Me Go"", and I think the book broke me. It was beautiful. Every single facet of the story had multiple layers to explore. For example, Kathy and Ruth were on the surface shown to be foils of each other. Ruth was shown as selfish and attention-hungry, while Kathy portrayed herself as an innocent bystander dragged along with Ruth's domineering personality. But, I realized, we see the entire story from Kathy's perspective, giving us privileged access to her internal monologue that rationalized her every action, which forcibly biased the book towards her. If you look at what she actually said and did, her and Ruth don't seem all that different. And at the end, when Ruth finally admits to keeping Tommy and Kathy apart, you realize that Ruth also had a rich internal life, and that if the book was written from Ruth's perspective, it wouldn't be all that different (see , a word I've always loved).Even more directly, it's amazing the book worked as well as it did. There was no plot, and the entire book was just first person recollections of a strange, alien world. The story itself was told non-linearly and weaved back and forth across time and characters: it was as close as you'll get to stream-of-consciousness in science fiction, and it ended at the beginning. And yet, it's incredibly compelling. Ishiguro has this way of portraying memory and time that almost makes the reader nostalgic for the memories of the character. By the end, I felt like the donor Kathy described in the first chapter, where I could remember being at Hailsham, and growing up with collections and Sales and the Gallery and Miss Lucy and Miss Geraldine and the rest. I cried at the end. The image of Kathy there, staring at the open field, crying and hoping for Tommy to appear in the distance, just tore me apart. It brought me back to when my grandmother died, and my mom's expression at her funeral: the emptiness in her eyes as she stared at the urn of ashes. Kathy was the last of the three, and in the end, she was alone, marching to her inevitable fate. And I guess that's the last big theme of the book: that there's no escape, and there's no point to run. Because even if Kathy tried to run, the world would continue marching on. Clones would be bred and sacrificed, and the new ones wouldn't have the benefits of Hailsham. They wouldn't be cultured or independent - in many ways, they wouldn't even be human. In some way, I think the running motif of Hailsham students feeling guilty for their privileges came to head at the end, when they all realized that there was nothing truly special about them, and they all were destined to naught. (This actually struck me as a great parallel to Blade Runner, and someday I want to do a Never Let Me Go - Blade Runner comparison.)I'll end this ramble with that striking image of Kathy standing in her dorm room, holding the pillow, and swaying along to Judy Bridgewater's ""Never Let Me Go."" Kathy had the innocent imagining of her holding a baby, hoping it would never let her go, but Madame had a much wider understanding of that moment. She thought it was Kathy holding onto the fragments of an old world that was falling from her grasp, like sand between your fingertips, but she still tried, holding on to what she could. It was the eternal struggle of science and efficiency against our own humanity, and in Ishiguro's world, humanity lost. I don't think it's not too far from our own reality.",0
"The Trend of Switching POVs Combined with Jumping Back and Forth in Time  Dark Places, The Girl on the Train, Big Little Lies & The Husband’s Secret, Beautiful Ruins, The Roanoke Girls, and many more. For a mystery, it can add a sense of urgency and drama to start at the end. However changing POVs and jumping between time periods can become repetitive and unnecessary. After reading one where I could skip pages and still not miss anything, I’m hesitant to read any popular semi-new books. Is anyone else wondering about this writing style and if it’s being overused lately? ",0

"Its a Wonderful Life isn’t about wanting to live, it’s about guilt.

George Bailey has obviously cared for and touched hundreds of people in Bedford Falls, including his wife and children, but in the end the reason he wants to live is to save the lives of his brother, and the other ancillary characters in town.  He’s essentially guilted into living by Clarence.  He couldn’t and will never be able to live for himself.  The last 5 minutes gives him a happy ending/an out of the particular bank circumstance he was in, but that’s not why he decided to live.  ",0
"I can't believe how good the Planet of the Apes trilogy is  I just finished 'War.'This trilogy is amazing.

"Finished ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" and decided to share my thoughts.  “I am young, I am twenty years old; yet I know nothing of life but despair, death, fear, and fatuous superficiality cast over an abyss of sorrow. I see how peoples are set against one another, and in silence, unknowingly, foolishly, obediently, innocently slay one another.”What an amazing but heart wrenching book. It really makes the reader think and consider what a horrible thing a war is, seen from the eyes of a young soldier who has lost the meaning of life. All he knows is war, he can’t go back because he does not know what he’ll be able to do out there, in the “normal” world, which is not filled with war and it’s atrocities. The book is filled with contemplations of life and it’s meaning, the futility of war and how the lives of young people, who have not yet experienced the world, are ruined by it.It was really hard to read it in such moments, because the author paints the picture and conveys the pain so vividly, that you can’t help but imagine how a person would feel in such a situation, sitting in a trench and hoping that an air strike or mortar shell will avoid him, hoping that lady fortune is on his side that day and he won’t be killed by a stray bullet or shrapnel. Just imagining the helplessness of a person in such situation is hard. What could a soldier do? Duck his head and pray, that’s it. His life was in the hands of luck and he can do nothing about it. Being unable to do anything to save your life and your friends is truly horrible… Give a man a chance to live, fight for his life, and he’ll do his hardest to survive, but having no chance at all and his life decided by luck… It just breaks a man.And then there’s another type of pain, which is caused by Paul’s contemplations about futility of war and life in general and what would he be able to do when and if he gets back home and deciding that his generation is lost, because they won’t be able to adapt to normal life. Just thinking about the fact that people of my age and younger were in that hell is really hard. Boys of 20 were already considered battle-hardened veterans, while there were even younger soldiers, who were absolutely clueless about the war and what they were supposed to do to survive…“We are not youth any longer. We don’t want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing. We fly from ourselves. From our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces.”As I’ve said, it’s a hard book to read but amazing and well worth it nonetheless. It’s a great anti-war book, which really shows the hardships of young soldiers fighting in the WW1.",0
"Ebook readers and abandoning books I've just realized that I tend to abandon books more easily ever since I switched to an ebook reader a few years ago. Before that, I used to stick with a book even if it turned out to be mediocre and would only drop ones that were outright bad or badly translated. Nowadays I just move on to another book leaving the unfinished one in the ""maybe someday"" pile, which is steadily growing.   I wonder if I simply got more impatient with age or if it's something I can at least partially blame on the device. What are your experiences? ",0

"Which author has, in your opinion, the best prose?  Like many of you I love prose. As we read it, it seems effortless but the only reason why it flows so well is because of the ridiculous amount of time authors put into them.

"Trying to find the name of a playwright... I remember years ago in university learning about a playwright who was quoted as saying that writing is worth something only if it makes you blush when people you know read it. For the life of me, I can remember neither who said it, nor what the exact quote is. I've tried Googling the phrasing in all variations that I can think of but I just can't find it. If it helps, I believe the playwright was a 20th-century American writer. He may also have originally planned to set one of his plays in a bleak landscape to reflect the mind but later changed to a more traditional setting...but that may also have been someone else. It's been a while. Any help would be much appreciated. ",0

"SPOILERS I just finished It by Stephen King and I want to hear other people's reviews  So I just finished It by Stephen King and I'm really torn on what to think about it. On one side I feel as if the length of the book(1150 some pages) is justified and that we needed it to fully understand the context of everything that is happening. Yet on the other hand, I do feel as if King kinda drawled out the story. The plot was well done and it drew me to really get to know all of the main characters: Ben, Bev, Eddie, Bill, Richie and Mike. But towards the end of the book it got really weird with the whole turtle god, astral projection, and child orgy thing. I would give IT maybe a 4 out of 5 stars.

It was one of those books where I disliked reading it but the plot was interesting enough to want to finish the book.

"""A wrinkle in time"" question (SPoiler!!)  So i remember reading this book in 5th grade and I think it changed my life.  Definitely is THE book that sparked my love of reading throughout my formative years.  Anyway, with the movie coming, and my children all reaching the age they would enjoy the book, I have decided to read aloud with my family (we've never done this before, though my kids read to themselves all the time). So we started last night and the kids were highly engaged.  They didn't want to stop after the first 3 chapters, but we needed to call it a night.  I read the rest of the book after they went to bed (first time since I was a kid), and there's a scene that I ""remember"", but it wasn't on this version of the book I downloaded.  It might be from another story or maybe even the sequel to wrinkle in time.  I remember a scene where Meg is saving her father, and she is told that whatever she does, do not let go of his hand.  IT turns his hand blistering hot, then freezing cold, at one point it turned into something slippery, and she almost dropped it. But she of course holds on telling herself it isn't real but IT mind tricks.  After reading ithe book again, that scene is nowhere to be found.  Maybe the kindle version cut it?  Most likely I am remembering a scene from a different book, but in my childhood's mind I had placed it in ""Wrinkle in time"".  It's really bothering me!Tl;DR.  I recall the previous paragraph happening in ""Wrinkle in time"", but upon reread now, it's not there.  I'd like to know if anyone else remembers such a scene and maybe if it's from a different book, perhaps one of the sequels. ",0

"Forgotten classic: The Assyrian by Nicholas Guild  After listening to Dan Carlin's Kings of Kings podcast earlier this summer, I caught the Ancient Near East (Mesopotamia) bug and was looking for historical fiction set in that era. Stumbled upon ""The Assyrian"" by Nicholas Guild and was absolutely blown away by it and its sequel ""The Blood Star,"" which are basically one long book telling the epic story of semi-fictional ancient Assyrian prince Tiglath Ashur, from his childhood days in the king's palace to leading the great armies of Assyria against civilizations such as the Egyptians, Babylonians and Scythians (think Dothraki from Game of Thrones). Along the way he rubs shoulders with real historical figures such as his conflicted royal brother Esarhaddon, the king's scheming lady Naq'ia, the Nubian Pharaoh Taharqa and more. Guild's research really is impressive. Nearly all the major events actually happened, and he seamlessly weaves them into a compelling narrative filled with romance, betrayals and conquests. It's not all violence and drama, either - Tiglath's companions have distinct and fun personalities, especially his rascally slave Kephalos, and the dialogue is witty and sometimes quite funny.If you like historical fiction or just a really well-written tale with complex characters and surprising twists and turns, it's definitely worth tracking down a copy.

"Saul Bellow: Novels 1944-1953: Dangling Man, The Victim, and The Adventures of Augie March I just finished these three novels, published by The Library of America. Prior to reading these, the only other work by Bellow I had read was Ravelstein, which I loved. I was really impressed by the last of the three: The Adventures of Augie March. It was around the same length of the other two books combined. Actually no, it might have even been twice the length of them combined, but it never felt like a slog to get through. It flowed so well. I could have kept going with the story, and when I was done it left me wanting more. I've went ahead and ordered the other two collections from the same publisher, as well.   Augie's story really resonated with me, and not because we have any similarities at all. We really don't. But his was a story of love and tragedy, and who can't relate to that? My favourite quote from the whole book was: “We took the coal-and-ice dealers into taverns and drank beer and swapped talk, in those sleepy and dark with heat joints where the very flies crept rather than flew, seeming doped by the urinal camphors and malt sourness, and from the heated emptiness and woodblock-knocking of the baseball broadcast that gave only more constriction to the unlocatable, undiagnosed wrong. If you thought to something outside, it might be Padilla theorizing on the size of the universe; his scientific interest kept the subject from being grim. But in such places the slow hairy fly-crawl from drop to drop and star to star, you could pray the non-human universe was not entered from here, and this was no sack-end of it that happened to touch Cook County and Northern Illinois.""

There's nothing I love more than transporting myself into another world - a world with fantastical beings who love, care and fight with each other - magic that I won't ever see in real life, and crazy plots and events that will never happen to me. It's about wanting to live in a world that doesn't exist to me. For hours at a time when I read, I'm happy with the nonexistent creatures that I won't ever meet and the emotions that I'll never feel.

"Finished reading Orwell's ""1984""... And I have to admit, It was pretty underwhelming. Perhaps it was really hyped up for me before i read it, or maybe I just expected something more, or maybe I'm missing some important detail. If you read what I have to say and have comments below, I'd love to hear them! So I always understood that it was supposed to be a cautionary tale about a world plunged into communism, where the people had absolutely no power to oppose the government. Instead, I feel like I got a drawn out look into the life of a man going through a midlife crisis who happens to be a member of an occupying communist party. And while it does sprinkle in some ideas along the way of the overall goal of the book (which I assume to be about the perils of communist government), I can't help but feel that the main idea isn't dumped on the reader at the end, much like how the ""Wonders of Communism (as opposed to Capitalism)"" were pushed on the reader in the last chapter of   ""The Jungle"". When I first started reading the book, I figured it would be a bit of a slow burner, but it overall felt like a slog to get through it after about the midway point. towards the end when Winston is reading through the book, that was the most mind numbing reading I've ever done in a literary classic.  In the end, I don't feel that the book had much impact on me. Perhaps its because I live in a world that is post cold war and the red fear doesn't hang over the United States anymore. One really could draw a parallel between Winston's story to that of Peeta in the hunger games: Guy lives in a world with an oppressive government post mass-destructive-military-event, becomes disenfranchised with the government, tries to fight it, gets captured, brainwashed, loves government. Now of course, Peta's story doesn't end there, but Winston's does. I don't know, maybe it's just behind my time, it's still a good book. I think ""Animal Farm"" was better, though. ",0
"I miss my books  Ever since I was a kid, I always loved reading. My great-grandmother was a Kindergarten teacher, and when I was born, told my parents that the most important thing was for me to learn to love books and read them at the first opportunity I could. Some of my earliest memories are of being very young and trying to make my way through Goodnight Moon, Cat in the Hat, and Go, Dog, Go! As I got older, I would get books for birthday presents, from Scholastic school newsletter ordering forms, and Christmas. A Series of Unfortunate Events was one of the first ""lengthy"" series I'd read when I was 8 or so, and that spurred me on to want to read even more. By the time I was 10 years old, my room was more akin to a library, with bookshelves overflowing with novels. As a teen, I'd moved onto reading things like The Hunger Games, the Divergent series, Nancy Drew, The Hobbit, and more. Now, I'm 20, and my love of reading has never wavered. I'd even gotten a new shelving unit for my books this year.  And then hurricane Harvey happened. In the span of a single night, 20 years of book collecting was destroyed. More so my entire house. A few days after being evacuated, I went back to see the damages, and of course, it was all gone. Hundreds of books were water damaged and unable to be salvaged. It was numbing, at the moment, but I was still in shock.  Today, I moved into my new home. It really hit me when I went into my new room and set up my bed and chair. The books that I'd always had weren't there anymore. The room is full, and yet, without them, it feels empty. I'm not sure if I'll try to slowly replace my favorites, or just go out and get an eReader, or what. But...I just felt like I needed to share that. Thanks.",0
"Batman/Bruce Wayne only has one line in the first 36m 50s of Batman Returns  This is my typical Christmas movie and is something I've noticed before, but I kept track tonight. I think this goes to show how this movie is so much more about the villains than it is about Batman.His first appearance is at 13:04. He then has a brief fight with Penguin's gang and has his first line at 17:05, ""we'll see."" He then goes missing for nearly 20 minutes until he and Alfred are watching the Penguin on the news and he finally has his second line of the movie.",0
"[Discussion] The Death of Ivan Illich  Hey guys. I recently finished reading Death of Ivan Illich. What a great book! I finished it with a lot of questions in my head, mainly:""Where did Ivan Illich go wrong?"". I was hoping I can post my review of the book here and people would comment on how they would answer the question above. Here it goes:The story of a judge with power, beauty, position and fame who saw his world crumbling down right before his very eyes and all he could do was sit, watch, and suffer excruciatingly. The author tells the story from the perspective of Judge Ivan Ilyich.The story opens up with a funeral: one for Ivan Ilyich. A lot of characters are present. The author makes a point to mention two characters who were competing for Ivan Ilyich's governmental position. We hear from the widow that Ivan Ilyich has been screaming for 3 days before his death.The author starts with the birth of Ivan Ilyich. His father was a government official of some sort. His two elder brothers, one was handsomer and one was stronger than Ivan Ilyich but he was the one who was successful in the end. We hear the story of how he met his wife. That his relationship of his wife was one of both social prestige and love. How she was the prettiest girl.We hear later of some problems that occurred between them after marriage. How she became bored more times than most and how she asked him many times to abandon his favourite bridge nights and stay with her. He saw it as she trying to get him to be bored with her. We later hear of how he developed a distance from her. How he treated his wife as he would've treated his courthouse; with calculated respect and professional distance. His wife later was happy that he spent his time with her, but he was doing it as part of an act he was maintaining. There was no love there anymore.He hit his side, but he bounced back without a problem, so he thought. After a while, he faced many money issues, especially after moving out to another district. He had to keep up appearances and that meant that the life he had was slowly increasing its upkeep and couldn't keep up with his salary. He was always short on money. He never sat down with his wife to have a conversation with her. It was an act he was maintaining and trying his damnable best not to disturb the silence.Slowly but surely, the pain in his side began to increase little by little. It started with him travelling many miles to get a job with a salary of 5,000 rubles. His current salary was not enough.He slowly began to disintegrate after his pain. He started feeling it every time. Coming and going in short bursts. Every time he thinks its going, it hits back. The doctors tell him that they don't know. This goes on for around 3 months.His wife and kids one time enter into his bedroom where he was lying down and they begin talking about an actress they were going to see that very night and which show did she star in; how good she was in this and that show. The man was struck in horror on how they were caring for nonsense rather than caring for him. He was to the point of begging for someone to pity him; to pity him just like a child; to pity him and remind him of how fair life is and how happy he would be.He remembered a syllogism of all men are mortal. Kasas is a man. Therefore kasas is mortal. Ivan Ilyich mentioned thinking of Kasas as an abstract man, not of himself as Kasas. Kasas never had the schooling he had or the women he had or the power he had or the money and house and kids and job and career and authority and judgement and sanity and intelligence and strength and youth and prestige and fame and reputation that he had.A very important thing he mentioned later is that he thought that everyone was playing a trick on him by treating him as an sick person and not as a person who is about to die. He wanted someone to pity him as a person who is about to die, not as a sick person who, given the right dosages of the right medicines, would bounce up as he used to be. He wanted them to make it a big deal.In the end, he died shouting because he realized that he did everything wrong and the only thing that calmed him down after 3 days of constant horror shouting was his admission to that realization.I see this story as a cautionary tale about living. While Ivan thought he was living the good life, it only led to suffering and death. Not until hours before dying, does he realize that what he had thought was the correct way to live was, in fact the, cause of his suffering. Once he accepts his suffering and the inevitability of death, does he realize that the purpose of life is not to be the cause of suffering for yourself and others",0

"Why do blurbs on the back give so much away? I'm not sure if this is something that other people find really frustrating but I know I have discussed it with a few people who agree. I hate blurbs on books; so many seem to give away huge amounts of the plot and, quite often, end up giving spoilers.
  I like to be intrigued by a short overview of the story and often find myself midway though a book when I realise that something in the blurb is yet to happen.
  I've taken to only reading the first paragraph of them since I had a large plot twist spoiled when I read 'Doomsday book' by Connie Willis. (Fantastic book, mind you)  Is this something that anyone else finds irritating? ",0

"My attempt to read 'A Game of Thrones'  So my school is hosting this book discussion on the book (I know, I'm as surprised as you are).

"Thomas Mann; Joseph and his Brothers  Anyone read it? (Pun not intentional, though affirmed).

 I looked up his bibliography and found this. I will probably not go at it right now but I would like to hear someones thought about it. How much biblical knowledge is necessary?

"What is the cultural relevance of Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám?  I've noticed references to this book in various sources throughout my life, not particularly often but frequently enough that I immediately recognise it and have become somewhat familiar with its origins. However I don't understand why it specifically is used, and I suspect it is employed simply to provide a pseudo-sophisticated plot device; however I also fear it is more than a trope and I'm merely demonstrating my naivety of heavier literature.Does the content have any literary relevance to modern scholars/readers/authors, or is there a reason the book should be featured or quoted repeatedly in fiction?*Edited for pedantic grammar reasons",0
"Your opinion on the portrayal of women in SHOGUN?  I've just finished reading Shogun, and while I enjoyed many things about it, one thing that made me feel confused if not uncomfortable at times was the portrayal of women (particularly those in Japanese society).I sadly don't have specific passages saved, but Clavell seems to hit and re-use every major female trope and adjective in his descriptions of women. I lost track of how often the reader is reminded of Kiku-san's beauty. Mariko-san goes at great lengths throughout the novel to remind Blackthorne (and the reader) of woman's place in Japanese society and how it is completely subservient to men and samurai and about how it makes sense and is the best system in the world and Blackthorne should just fuck his consorts because he'd be doing THEM a favor. With his big white dick, of course. Or how nearly every scene between two women hits the age-old stereotype of devolving into a discussion about the men in the story or somehow becoming a discussion for plotting in secrecy and general conniving. I don't know if I'm overthinking this and would love to hear other people's thoughts about this part of the novel. I haven't really seen this touched upon before, so maybe it's just me!",0
"Down and Out in Paris and London: Fact or Fiction, and does it matter?  If you haven't read Orwell's , I highly recommend it. Orwell is almost always very readable, and  is entertaining with great characterisation, especially of some of the non-Britons he meets while in Paris.My edition is not an annotated one, so I am reliant on wikipedia and other internet sources for the background of the book, and I think it raises an interesting question. According to Orwell:I think I can say that I have exaggerated nothing except in so far as all writers exaggerate by selecting. I did not feel that I had to describe events in the exact order in which they happened, but everything I have described did take place at one time or another. Selective reporting is something that is now frequently argued as dishonest or sensationalist. Additionally, according to that same page, Orwell covered up the true robber to spare his parents' sensibilities, may have taken up casual labour in restaurants at least in part for research, and on at least one occasion wrote home for money, which I would argue means he was never truly 'down and out'.I enjoyed this book and feel I did learn something from it. The kind of wage slavery and reliance on public services and charity he describes are unfortunately still a necessary fact of life for many people today. However, I'm struggling to decide how I feel about Orwell's selective reporting. On the one hand such engaging narratives help those of us who are not and have never been in that position to understand what it might be like, but on the other it feels in some way dishonest, or that the interesting and sympathetic characters are the only ones who deserve any way out of lifestyles such as these. What should a narrative like  achieve, and does it matter if a little selective reporting and polite covering up helps achieve it?",0

"Don't see the purpose anymore - so jealous and irrational  Hi all, I'm 19 and a sophomore in college. I have no friends here to hang out with, and I have no friends here. I am in 5 classes and 6 clubs, so I definitely am exploring all clubs I possibly can (and I am very active for all 6). I do have an online friend that I have talked too everyday since we met online back in 2013. But, even my online friend has all these friends she parties with on the weekends. I just get so jealous of her that she has all these friends to party with and I have nobody - because let's face the reality that she only texts me when she is bored - which is actually quite frequently. I get hostile towards her whenever she parties or goes out and I block her. I suppose it is because I am a very very competitive person and I am losing in the game called friends. 
But that is the story of my life for everything. I am always put last. Nobody talks to me first (I am actually an outgoing person, and can be overly loud at and commanding at times). I have never drank, or smoked, or had sex or anything like that. I am an INTJ on the Myers-Briggs personality scale. It just kills me how I have nobody. Everyone is out partying and hanging out with friends, while I have absolutely nothing to do on weekends. I just don't see any purpose in life anymore, where I have always been a kid that is full of life and positive energy. ",0
"How do I become a better reader?  Recently, I have become increasingly aware of how slowly and ineffectively I read. This year I enrolled in AP English Language and Composition (11th grade), and the curriculum calls for reading passages and answering questions in a short amount of time. When a passage from Ralph Waldo Emerson was given, I could only answer four of the fifteen questions because it took me almost the entire given time just to read the excerpt.After reflecting on how I read, I have decided that I take so long for multiple reasons- I zone out frequently (which causes me to re-read sentences multiple times), I have to read every word to make me feel as though I truly understand the material, and I constantly ""deconstruct"" the meanings of whatever the passage means.As you can see, this style of reading is not helpful in an academic environment. I want nothing more than to learn ways to fix these habits so that I can be successful at school, and so that they can transfer over to my leisurely reading as well. What can I do?",0

I remember have read the first volume of The Lord of the Rings at 7 in one day, I was interessed in ""plays book"".. but then, school asked to read books during holydays, and I totally stopped reading just because I used to read for entertainment purpose on my will ; I didn't wanted to be forced to read books. So from, 9/10 until now, I haven't touched a book or finished it, even if I was enjoying my reading because it was for school and not for me. But lately, I found myself wanting to read, tried with books in my libraby but they doesn't match anymore. (read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy younger and my libraby is almost only that)
So what ? Let's buy some new books that you're interessed in and that's all ?Almost.. Thing is, I had the idea of reading in english to improve my vocabulary. I watch movies, videos, series in english so why not ? But I'm scared of being tired because at the beginning i'll need to look at the vocabulary on internet, or i'll be so slow that'll lost my concentration.. things like that.

"Any thoughts on Bone, by Jeff Smith?  I recently started to reread it and I was hit with the thought that I don't know what it's about thematically. It's honestly one of my favorite books, but when looking for broader ideas I've come up short. The most in-depth thing I've noticed is that it does a great job raising the stakes as the plot progresses. What starts as a pretty cartoonish (ha) children's story slowly builds into a serious narrative with substantial stakes and consequences for its characters. And the tone is almost always spot on. Smith knows exactly when and how to get an emotion from his readers. Just wondering if anyone else would be interested in talking about this great book that no one ever seems to talk about.",0

Do the Vince Flynn novels have the same flow after the prequels? Set myself a goal to read the entire Mitch Rapp series. Love the POV of Mitch. So far I've read American Assassin and Kill Shot (the prequels). Currently on Transfer of Power. Does the story flow well since Kill Shot was published in 2012 while Transfer of Power was published in 1999?,0
"""White Noise"" in the American Dream Some great books, as time goes on, become shrouded in the mystery of context and societal norms. Other great books, as time goes on, feel fresher and more important than on the day they were written. The reader finds themselves muttering, 'if they only knew' about an author who crafts a story that is equal parts insightful into the times they are writing from and predictive of the future in which we read. Don DeLillo constructed one of these works with White Noise. A comedic take on Americans fear of death and subsequently the consumerism that has taken over American and its effect on the family and the individuals in that family. DeLillo is writing at the advent of the technology age as we know it, but his insights into the affect it had and will have on the individual seem truer now than I am sure they did at the time. The American family is swathed in the white noise brought in by the faith man has taken from previous foundations like religion and family and placed into information, science, and technology. The advent of a 'toxic event' reveals the issues with this new state of man. They fear death and search for an escape from that fear in absurdities and minutiae of life. DeLillo uses the absurd and the comedic to help us understand the plight of consumerist America. The reader will find humor in the struggles of the characters to reconcile their fears with the world they live and fear in how applicable these absurd realities are to our own. DeLillo wrote about truth and truth only becomes more true as time goes on. DeLillo's writing is as clipped and frantic as the struggle of Jack Gladney. Sentences end before they should and topics are changed and returned to before the end of a page. His sentences are enjoyable and important as he poses ideas at a rapid rate. His prose was tone setting and immersive if not a times a bit garbled much like the white noise that finds itself as the looming backdrop for this story. DeLillo's story is serviceable if not particularly enjoyable. If a book were only judged by theme and prose, as many are, a man would be hard pressed to find error in this novel. But I feel a story and it's friendliness and agreeableness is important for a book (The National Book Critic Award would probably disagree and who am I to argue?). So when I read a book as important and intriguing as ""White Noise"" I do not want to detracts from its significance but can't help but feel that my personal enjoyment of the book was lessened when the story takes a back seat to themes and ideas. Themes 5/5- The themes and motifs of White Noise get truer by the minute. Writing 5/5- Immersive and tone setting for an intriguing and meaningful book. Story 3/5- Not to draw away from how good the book was, but I love a book with a good story and this narrative was not on the forefront of DeLillo's to-do-list with this book. Not an issue, just the way it is. 83/100 ",0
"Reflections on 'His Dark Materials' by Philip Pullman [Spoilers] I must have been about 11 when my mother told me I had to pick a book.  The hallway of my school had been re-purposed into an impromptu bookshop to incentivise us to read more.  I was never much into reading for leisure but was vaguely aware it was important so I dutifully started looking for something.  I quickly spotted a red book with a knife on the front. This is for me I thought.  I was disappointed, when upon inspection, it was actually the second book of a series.  I noted the name of the first book, The Northern Lights, and found it.  This book looked less exciting, coloured a cold blue and with a less interesting picture on the front - some kind of brass instrument.  Nevertheless, logic dictated I start with book one. My mother bought it for me.  I didn't know it, and she didn't know it, but that was the moment my love affair with reading began.  I read The Northern Lights.  Then I read The Subtle Knife.  My imagination lit up. I couldn't believe it.  Lyra and Will were like my best friends, I felt I knew them intimately. I went to the bookshop in town to look for the third book but couldn't find it.  My family didn't even have a dial up connection then, so, as strange as it sounds now, I wasn't able to find the final book at that time. I few years went by and I read constantly.  Terry Pratchett's discworld series, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and of course, Rowling's Harry Potter all feature prominently in my teenage years. Some years after finishing The Subtle Knife I found myself in a large bookshop.  I spotted a yellow-orange coloured book and recognised the style of the artwork.  I flicked through the pages and confirmed my suspicion.  I held The Amber Spyglass - the conclusion to the story.  To this day I've never held a book with such excitement!  My parents, ever keen to keep me reading, bought it for me. I don't recall exactly how long it took me to finish it.  All I remember is the feeling I was left with.  Rarely in my life have I ever felt such profound emotion.  I was so sad for Lyra and Will and that emotion didn't leave me for days.  In my day dreams I defied the ending and devised alternatives in which they lived happily, and together, ever after.  It's an ending that sticks with me until this very day.  And yet, it was also not sad, it was a triumph for the good guys.   It's been over 10 years, closer to 15 actually, since I read His Dark Materials.  La Belle Sauvage comes out in a few weeks and I can't wait!  I'm so looking forward to entering that world again.  As an adult it's so easy to get caught up in the practicalities of life.  I've resolved to be more like my teenage self and simply take the time now and again to enjoy a good story. ",0

"Just finished Cats Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut. Wtf did I just read?  As the title says, I just finished Cats Cradle. I have no idea what it was about. It didn’t seem to have a beginning. It suddenly ended. And I have no idea what really happened in the middle. To be fair when it comes to books that have some deep existential meaning, my depth is about as deep as a puddle. And maybe this book doesn’t have a deep existential meaning and I just completely missed it. Maybe it was a huge joke wrapped up in a book and I missed it. Maybe it was a commentary on life and religion and what not and maybe I missed it. Could someone please help me understand what was going on. ",0

"How do I acclimate myself to studying difficult literature, for academic purposes?  As my username suggests, I am a freshman French literature student at my country's second best university. My mother tongue is Persian, and I got 95/120 on TOEFL exam when I was 17. I can ace it if I take the exam now. I used to be an English student but I switched majors because of what Trump did. Certainly, there's bad blood between the Anglosphere and the Persians. Anyhow, I dropped out of English literature before we got to the good part: reading books. When I was a kid I used to read a lot. My favorite book of all time is The Shadow Spinner by Susan Feltcher. I really want to have this book in English but I can't find it. Anyways, I want to be a bookworm again. I'm 24 now and I haven't read a book in 6 years. I used to read Les Misérable once a year. Used to just borrow it from my uncle and got at it. I want to be that guy again. But I don't know how to achieve this goal. Has this happened to anyone else? There's not many English books available here. Only pirated books. My brother is currently reading Franny and Zooey (bought it for 2$). I will be exasperated if someone would be kind enough to help me find my zeal for reading again. Thanks. ",0
What's the difference between the two versions of Stephen King's IT? I wanted to read the book before watching the film so I headed over to Amazon to buy a copy. However I noticed that there are two versions. The newer version to accompany the film has 1100+ pages and the older version had 1300+ pages. Is the infamous orgy scene cut from the newer version or was the book rewritten with less filler or something? 200 pages seems like a big chunk to cut from a book.,0
"I just finished Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut...  and I am so underwhelmed.  Slaughterhouse five was such amazing book, and I loved breakfast of champions, but this one just did nothing for me.

Two of my all-time favorite books are Stephen King's Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers, which are widely regarded - from what I've seen anyway - as his worst. They're both a bit all over the place in the narrative department but it never really bothered me because the stories themselves had hardcore surrealistic/LSD vibes. I also love the Rain Wild Chronicles which is widely regarded by my fellow fantasy geeks as the weakest series of books in the Realm of Underlings universe. I'm one of the few who actually preferred it to all of the Fitz trilogies. I loved the array of colorful characters, the Rain Wild culture itself and just in terms of Hobb's writing I greatly appreciated the third person POV (I get annoyed so easily by first-person) ",0

"Trials of the Earth (Mary Mann Hamilton)  Just finished this book and I feel like I have a new appreciation for the civilization that has blossomed in SE America, with all of its good and its bad. Reading this book felt like sitting down with someone's Grandma and listening to her tell her life story - it's not written as a academic essay or a literary masterpiece, but simply is a telling of what life was life for an early American pioneer family. The author was also the first woman to pioneer the Mississippi Delta, and her stories live up to the roughness you would imagine she would experience, but she also somehow found the best in the events of her daily life. Would 10/10 recommend.Has anyone else read it?

"Finished listening to Heart of Darkness and am whelmed. Did i do something wrong?  Hi all, 
I'm a new music teacher (like less than 2 months) and have found myself with about 3 hours a day where I just drive because of my long commute. To help fill the time between listening to NPR and Biggie I downloaded some audio books. The first one I listened to was Heart of Darkness and to be honest I feel that I didn't get it. There wasn't anything about the book that really impressed me in any way, the way the narrative was brought forth as a story told to a group that we are told didn't want to to hear it didn't feel compelling, nor was there any real pay off for me, either with the discovery of Kurtz, the way he died, or Marlow's interaction with his widow. I was neither overwhelmed or underwhelmed, just... whelmed. It felt like nothing truly mattered because everything was awful and horrifying and nothing changes. I am forced to wonder then if this might have been the point. From reading other people's perspective on this book and from Thug Notes I gather that the main idea was that both the savages and the Europeans contained their own heart of darkness, one symbolized by the jungle and one by the dealings between people. Could the ""rambling storyteller"" approach be a commentary on how neither will change? Even though civilization can take over, there will still be darkness, so what is there to do but talk about a trip, recognizing all the awful things but never actually doing anything about it. There was no change in any of the character's, no growth, no one learned anything productive. Kurtz was still crazy when he died, and Marlow was simply wearied by the thought of everything he experienced, was not empowered or given the tools to change anything. He received knowledge without purpose and could not bring himself to act on it. The listeners to the story never wanted to hear it in the first place and only interact when Marlow insults their professions and so nothing comes of them either. Nothing that happened to Marlow even made for a good, enticing story and the fact that he told it for over 3 hours only makes it that much more useless in it's quest to prove a point to the listeners in the book.So, is this the point, that nothing matters and everything is bad so why bother, or am I just completely missing everything that is really happening and I should listen (or physically read) again?",0
"What do you think will occur in Iron Gold (Red Rising sequel trilogy)? WARNING: There will be Red Rising spoilers in this thread  Brown announced that whereas the RR trilogy was about taking power from tyrants, IG will be about maintaining that freedom and peace.

This is one of the first times I've seen an author go beyond that glory of victory and get down into how it is maintained and protected.

My Take on Bright and Hopefulness for More Lore from its Universe. So Bright has been pretty controversial. Most critics hate it but most fans love it. It’s definitely quite interesting to see how this will turn out for the future. I feel like this could turn into a real franchise. The universe itself is pretty broad. The movie does some outstanding world building. We get a pretty brief history of what happens and why things are the way they are in modern times. We understand for the most part that history is relatively unchanged with these other species filling in other roles that might have been previously held by other human races. The potential the Bright universe has is so expansive. There could be so many stories to be told in that universe with it having the other species involved. It would be really interesting to see more of that universe in different places around the world in all different periods of time There is so much to see with other species at play. Like where does the other species fit in the history of slavery or the Holocaust? Humans seem to ignore their own different races and seem to be united as a species but at the cost of xenophobism of other species like Orcs. Does another species endure the Holocaust instead of Jews? How does WW2 play out? Are the slaves of the US another species instead of Africans? Where would other species play in effect during the Mongol’s campaign back in the day? It’s almost like this universe would benefit from being a TV show instead. Imagine this universe at the level of Game of Thrones. Maybe each season focuses on a different time period and place on Earth. One season can be modern day in England. The next season could be the Wild West in the US. The next season could be about pirates in the West Indies. Another season could be about maybe a Civil Rights Movement of other species. The possibilities are endless and I’m excited to see more from this universe.We know a sequel is planned and will most likely focus on Ward and Nick again as I’d expect. But maybe we will see more species. Apparently there are way more than what is shown in the movie. We haven’t really gotten to see the full scope of what this Earth is like. I really hope this can turn into a franchise. With more world building content this could end up being a real hit. I think the missing key is a television series expanding the lore. What do you guys think?,0

You came upon me carving some kind of little figure out of wood and you said, “Why don’t you make something for me?”I asked you what you wanted, and you said, “A box.”“What for?”“To put things in.”“What kind of things?”“Whatever you have,” you said.Well, here’s your box. Nearly everything I have is in it, and it is not full.

"Dracula vs Hitler was a missed opportunity (spoilers)  I liked the conception of the novel as an epistolary novel like the original Dracula, but the early goings of the novel had dreadful pacing. It takes more than half the book for the action sequences to start happening ""on screen"". At this point, the book kicks into high gear and becomes super entertaining, but I couldn't shake the concern that because it took place in 1941 and was not presented as an alternate history but as an ""untold"" history, that it would have an unfulfilling non-ending. I was right. The final third of the book was extremely entertaining and then the ending left me completely cold. I went in skeptical, remained skeptical for a large portion of the book, suddenly started to really like it, and hated how it wrapped up. Anyone have any thoughts on this one?",0
"Google Play will soon sell audiobooks  If you listen to audiobooks, chances are that you’ve probably purchased it from Audible. Now, it looks as though Google will begin selling audiobooks trough its Google Play store. 9to5Google is reporting that the company has begun advertising audiobooks, and that a user’s first audiobook purchase will be 50 percent off.The hub isn’t currently accessible, and 9to5Google says that there’s no indication of when the store will go live. But it seems that the company is laying the groundwork for an audiobook store. Android Police found references to Audiobooks in an APK teardown of the Google Play app back in November, and The Android Soul conducted an APK teardown of the latest update to the Google Play Books app, and found code for several new features, including audiobooks. The code points to audiobooks in the store, and that the app will allow users to navigate through the chapters using chapter titles — Audible’s app allows for similar navigation, but only by chapter numbers — and that the app will allow users to keep track of their progress on multiple devices. The teardown also points to Google Cast functionality. We’ve reached out to Google, and will update if we hear back.If it happens, Google’s move into the audiobook market could be significant, because it would challenge Amazon’s domination of the market. While there are several retailers out there, such as Audiobooks.com or Libro.fm, Audible is the leading retailer, and has enjoyed a surge in popularity in the format. As sales of audiobooks have exploded in recent years, and a dedicated storefront would give Google a foot in the door to capture some of those sales within its own digital ecosystem.",0
"Attention Span or Selective Attention?  I recently sat down to watch a movie with a couple of friends, one of which couldn't watch the film without checking his phone every 15 minutes. This is typical behaviour for the guy but it sparked an interesting discussion between us on preferences in media consumption. Among the group, I was the only one who had read books outside of required reading for school and it came to my attention that they preferred movies/tv to reading because it doesn't require your full attention. I don't frequent social media nearly as much as they do, but I was wondering if that's what lead to this preference or if I was being too critical of how they spend their time. The constant feed of information (positive and garbage) makes me think that reading long form prose is losing its value. It's a bit sad because to them books are an inferior medium of consumption on the basis that they take too long to process, while I've always liked all media but reading has been my favourite activity for a while. A bit of a rant, but is the overall increase in social media playing into the decline in popularity of reading? ",0

"Saul Bellow: Novels 1944-1953: Dangling Man, The Victim, and The Adventures of Augie March  I just finished these three novels, published by The Library of America.Prior to reading these, the only other work by Bellow I had read was Ravelstein, which I loved.I was really impressed by the last of the three: The Adventures of Augie March. It was around the same length of the other two books combined. Actually no, it might have even been twice the length of them combined, but it never felt like a slog to get through. It flowed so well. I could have kept going with the story, and when I was done it left me wanting more. I've went ahead and ordered the other two collections from the same publisher, as well.  Augie's story really resonated with me, and not because we have any similarities at all. We really don't. But his was a story of love and tragedy, and who can't relate to that?My favourite quote from the whole book was:“We took the coal-and-ice dealers into taverns and drank beer and swapped talk, in those sleepy and dark with heat joints where the very flies crept rather than flew, seeming doped by the urinal camphors and malt sourness, and from the heated emptiness and woodblock-knocking of the baseball broadcast that gave only more constriction to the unlocatable, undiagnosed wrong. If you thought to something outside, it might be Padilla theorizing on the size of the universe; his scientific interest kept the subject from being grim. But in such places the slow hairy fly-crawl from drop to drop and star to star, you could pray the non-human universe was not entered from here, and this was no sack-end of it that happened to touch Cook County and Northern Illinois.""

There was a series of books by Hugo-award winner Ben Bova in the 2000s that dealt with space exploration, the ruthless capitalists that made it happen, and the way religious fundamentalism stood in the way of scientific process.In some ways, it's disturbingly prescient about the way our world is currently developing. One of the most interesting storylines in it was the rivalry between two billionaires who both wanted to get people into space. One wanted to propel mankind into space to save us from the effects of climate change, while the other one wanted to simply reap the profits from the solar system.

"I've set the date. Only a little while longer.  To my family I'm so sorry. I'm so so so fucking sorry. To him...how the fuck could you do this to me? You killed me inside before I finished it off. You were all I fucking had and you left me. 4 fucking years thrown away. I gave you everything, I gave you my entire heart. You betrayed me and I hope you remember every single time I called or texted you telling you I needed you. You could have stopped me. But I guess you'd be happier with me gone. You did this to me.  Happy 4 years. I love you so much. Please forgive me for not being good enough. ",0
"Just wasted $10,000  My professor was going to drop me from class if I didn't show up today. I'm sick though, professor, I can literally be off the toilet for no more than 15 minutes at a time or I'll shit myself. I'm still gonna get dropped, though I'm waiting for health services to try and help me out. Why would I go to class and get others sick? This is a golden rule in the industry, if you're sick, do not expose others to the illness.Anyway, was probably just dropped from the class, so there's $10,000 and a semester wasted. I can feel the sweet embrace coming to comfort me in this trying time. Death has got my back.",0
"Trouble accessing good scientific books Anyone else having trouble finding scientific books or journals? I love libraries but am disappointed that they don't carry many reference type books on medical or science topics. If I want to learn about psychology I want to look at the DSM 5 not read ""living with schizophrenia."" If I want to learn about space, I dont want a book written to enthrall 10 year olds, I want to read actual research papers. Why is it so hard to find accessible information after leaving college? ",0
